  description: "\\large{Liste Up, Cutter...} \\emph{There\'s lots of bashers that can plant you pretty fast, out here in the \\Place{planes}. And that\'s the only \'pretty\' thing about most of \'em. A blood\'s got to know what\'s what, or the results won\'t rise. A lot of creatures out here\'re just plain bad, and even the good ones can burn you if you rattle your bonebox wrong. What a cutter needs is a guide to what\'s out there, and if it\'s twice as big as the previous guide and illustrated in color, that\'s just a bonus. Sure, there\'s been other guide to planar creatures, but most\'re hard to find, don\'t scan the turf, or just don\'t have the straight chant...} This Monstrous Compendium appendix includes a broad spectrum of monsters from the \\Place{Inner}, \\Place{Outer}, \\Place{Astral}, and \\Place{Ethereal Planes}---all geared to provide hours of adventure in the \\Place{Planescape} campaign setting. Replacing the original \\Product{\\Place{Outer Plane} Appendix}, this new and enlarged compendium includes full-color illustrations, reintroducing many of the best multiplanar monsters from a wide variety of out-of-print sources."
