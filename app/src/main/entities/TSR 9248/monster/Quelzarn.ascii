  description: "\\Monster{Quelzarn} are giant, solitary water snakes found in both fresh and salt water. They are agile and swift hunters, and may be of magical origin. \n\n\\Monster{Quelzarn} are eel-like in appearance, with mottled brown or green slimy skin that is extremely slippery. The slime enables them to breathe air through skin membranes, and is often home to mosses and weed. \\Monster{Quelzarn} are usually 30-40 feet in length, and have a spinelike fin running the length of their backs. Broad, leaf-shaped fins cover their gills just behind their wide, toothed jaws, and a quelzarns head sports a bony, fin-shaped crest. \n\nQuelzarn have no distinct lairs. Any treasure found within a quelzarn will be inorganic matter that has been swallowed (such as coins and gems). The digestive juices of quelzarn slowly break down flesh, tissue, and even bone. The brain and cranial fluids of quelzarn have been found useful in the making of spell inks for slow and hold magics, and as a distillate in the manufacture of rings of free action. Quelzarn tissue is a useful alternative ingredient in the seasoning of wood to be used in the fashioning of wands of lightning. Quelzarn skin is leathery and snakelike, but death or severing causes it to cease producing its slimy coating. It soon shrivels into uselessness."

combat: "\\Monster{Quelzarn} will eat anything living (and carrion if desperate). They spend their days cruising for meals, or drifting while they digest one. \\Monster{Quelzarn} can cast a 60-foot-range \\Spell{hold monster} spell once every turn. They use this in battle and to immobilize prey. \\Monster{Quelzarn} are highly resistant to the polluted waters of busy harbors and vast swamps alike. They have been known to hold a sailor standing on a dock, and then rear out of the water to drag him down. \n\n\\Monster{Quelzarn} bite for 3-12 damage, and are capable of swallowing whole any creature of 4\\frac{1}{2} feet in height or less. (The victim, even if held, is allowed a Dexterity Check to avoid this fate.) Swallowed victims will drown in 6 rounds; they will find that the interior of a \\Monster{quelzarn} is AC 9, and inflicting 20 points of damage to one will cause the creature to spit its victim(s) out. Swallowed victims suffer only 1d2 points of damage from the creatures teeth. Angry quelzarn are capable of vomiting a swallowed creature out in order to bite it."
character: "Quelzarn are attracted by magical attempts to control their wills, but receive a saving throw every second round against such magics (or spell-like natural or item powers) to break free of control. \n\nThe interest of quelzarn in magic use, plus their shape and humanlike eyes, sometimes causes them to be mistaken for nagas.  Quelzarn roam great distances in their lives, and are thought to mate (they do so only seldomly) in deep undersea caves. They may cooperate with other creatures (in return for food), and will never attack another of their kind. If one quelzarn encounters another while attacking prey, they tend to ignore each other and attack independently rather than fighting or closely cooperating."
reproduction: "Quelzarn are thought to have a magical origin, perhaps the result of long-ago experimentation by mages of Unther (certainly, the creatures were once hunted there for sport). They have a natural magic resistance, and are entirely immune to all electrical attacks, both magical and natural."
