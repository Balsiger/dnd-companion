  description: "\\emph{Years ago, brave heroes put the denizens of the \\Place{Temple of Elemental Evil} to the sword. Now, dark forces whisper again in the shadows of the once-deserted temple---forces far more insidious and dangerous than any sane person could dream. Evil has risen again to threaten the village of \\Place{Hommlet}.} Characters battle the power of darkness in \\Place{Hommlet} and beyond, forging their way through hundreds of dire encounters before reaching the fiery finale. Designed as the backbone of a full campaign, \\Product{Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil} takes characters from 4th level to as high as 14th level. This deluxe adventure builds on the groundwork of the original \\Place{Temple of Elemental Evil} (published in 1985), as well as other classic adventures. However, none of those products are necessary to enjoy this one. To use this adventure, a Dungeon Master also needs the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}, the \\Product{Dungeon Master\'s Guide} and the \\Product{Monster Manual}. A player only needs the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}."
