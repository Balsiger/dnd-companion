  description: "When the \\NPC{Lord of \\Place{Tarsis}} finds himself with a politically volatile murder on his hands, he turns to the three most expendable inhabitants of the city of a solution. A \\Class{mercenary}, a Class{poet-assassin}, and a \\Class{thief} might not be everyone\'s first choice for detectives. But they find they\'re quite good at bringing murderers to justice. Perhaps a little too good..."
