  description: "\\emph{On a rugged island filled with unnatural dangers, fierce and proud barbarians must fight for their lives.} The barbarians who call themselves the \\Group{Knorr}, driven from their homeland, wanted nothing but freedom and an honorable existence when they landed on the shores of \\Place{Jakandor}. What they found was an island occupied by despicable wielders of vile magic---the \\Group{Broken People}, as the \\Group{Knorr} call them, who rely on legions of animated corpses to do their fighting. These enemies represent everything the \\Group{Knorr} find hateful and dishonorable, and no clansman will rest until the last of the \\Group{Broken People} has tasted \\Group{Knorrman} steel. A new, self-contained campaign arena conceived by Jeff Grubb, the \\Product{Odyssey} setting can be placed within any Advanced Dungeons & Dragons world. New barbarian character kits, new forms of magic, and the opportunity for new styles of role-playing make \\Product{Jakandor: Island of War} a fresh experience for all players, novices and veterans alike."
