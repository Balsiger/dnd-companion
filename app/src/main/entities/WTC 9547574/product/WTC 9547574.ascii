  description: "An antique map reveals yet another family secret: Nearra must relive the\nsuffering of two more of the wizards betrayed by her ancestor, or her family\'s magic and the healing power of the Trinistyr will never be restored. Undeterred, Nearra, Jirah, and their friends continue their mission, arriving at the once great city of Tarsis. But they do not journey alone. Two elf mages watch them from afar, while a dark cleric follows their every move. Betrayals come to light. New powers arise. And a startling revelation threatens to destroy Nearra, once and for all."
