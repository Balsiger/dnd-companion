  description: "\\large{How does a berk fight something he can\'t even undestand?}\n                    \\emph{Things\'re different on the \\Place{Inner Planes}. Oh, some bashers might\n                    say they\'re \\emph{deadlier}, or \\emph{harsher}, or just plain \\emph{weirder},\n                    but the truth is, they\'re merely different. And on planes full of nothing but\n                    searing magmas, swampy ooze, glittering mineral, utter desolation, or life\n                    incarnate, is it any wonder that a body\'d find creatures as alien as any the\n                    \\Place{multiverse} has ever seen? Things that eat color, leaving a victim\n                    fully transparent. Beasts that spread life like a virus, animating all things\n                    around them. Spirits that form bodies by forcing hundreds of smaller animals\n                    to act as one. It\'s enough to make a sod long for a \\Monster{pit fiend}.}\n                    Liven up any \\Product{Planescape} or AD&D campaign with the\n                    \\Product{Monstrouds Compendium Appendix III}, which features 128 pages of\n                    monsters that lurk on the \\Place{Inner Planes}, the \\Place{Astral Plane}, and\n                    the \\Place{Ethereal Plane}---some of the strangest and most inhospitable\n                    environments in the \\Place{multiverse}. Most of the critters are brand new,\n                    though a few old favorites have been updated. This book also provides a\n                    detailed look at the ecology of the planes in question, not to mention an\n                    appendix of inner-planar creatures that\'re more like animals than\n                    monsters. And, of course, all-new illustrations vividly bring each of these\n                    exotic beings to life."
