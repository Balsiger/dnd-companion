  description: "A few unintelligible words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe, when they are the words and gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy, but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend poring over her spellbook preparing each spell for casting, and the years before that spent in apprenticeship to learn the arts of magic.\n\nWizards depend on intensive study to create their magic. They examine musty old tomes, debate magical theory with their peers, and practice minor magics whenever they can. For a wizard, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art."

abbreviation: "Wiz"
adventures: "Wizards conduct their adventures with caution and forethought. When prepared, they can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. They seek knowledge, power, and the resources to conduct their studies. They may also have any of the noble or ignoble motivations that other adventurers have."
characteristics: "The wizard\342\200\231s strength is her spells. Everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition to learning new spells, a wizard can, over time, learn to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way.\n\nSome wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. Specialization makes a wizard more powerful in her chosen field, but it denies her access to some of the spells that lie outside that field. (See School Specialization, page 57.)\n\nLike a sorcerer, a wizard can call a familiar\342\200\224a small, magical animal companion that serves her. For some wizards, their familiars are their only true friends."
alignment_options: "Overall, wizards show a slight tendency toward law over chaos because the study of magic rewards those who are disciplined. Illusionists and transmuters, however, are masters of deception and change, respectively. They favor chaos over law."
religion: "Wizards commonly revere Boccob (god of magic). Some, especially necromancers or simply more misanthropic wiz- ards, prefer Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic). Evil necromancers are known to worship Nerull (god of death). Wizards in general are more devoted to their studies than to their spiritual sides."
background: "to their studies than to their spiritual sides. Background: Wizards recognize each other as comrades or rivals. Even wizards from very different cultures or magical traditions have much in common because they all conform to the same laws of magic. Unlike fighters or rogues, wizards see themselves as members of a distinct, if diverse, group. In civilized lands where wizards study in academies, schools, or guilds, wizards also identify themselves and others according to membership in these formal organizations. But while a guild magician may look down her nose at a rustic wizard who learned his arts from a doddering hermit, she nevertheless can\342\200\231t deny the rustic\342\200\231s identity as a wizard."
races: "Humans take to magic for any of various reasons: curiosity, ambition, lust for power, or just personal inclination. Human wizards tend to be practical innovators, creating new spells or using old spells creatively.\n\nElves are enthralled by magic, and many of them become wizards for love of the art. Elf wizards see themselves as artists, and they hold magic in high regard as a wondrous mystery, as opposed to the more pragmatic human wizards, who see magic more as a set of tools or tricks.\n\nIllusion magic comes so simply to gnomes that becoming an illusionist is just natural to brighter and more talented ones. Gnome wizards who don\342\200\231t specialize in the school of illusion are rare, but they don\342\200\231t suffer under any special stigma.\n\nHalf-elf wizards feel both the elf\342\200\231s attraction to magic and the\n\nhuman\342\200\231s drive to conquer and understand. Some of the most pow- erful wizards are half-elves.\n\nDwarf and halfling wizards are rare because their societies don\342\200\231t encourage the study of magic. Half-orc wizards are rare because few half-orcs have the brains necessary for wizardry. Drow (evil, subterranean elves) often take up wizardry, but wizards are quite rare among the savage humanoids."
otherClasses: "Wizards prefer to work with members of other classes. They love to cast their spells from behind strong fighters, to \342\200\234magic up\342\200\235 rogues and send them out to scout, and to rely on the divine healing of clerics. They may find members of certain classes (such as sorcerers, rogues, and bards) to be not quite serious enough, but they\342\200\231re not judgmental."
role: "The wizard\342\200\231s role depends somewhat on her spell selection, but most wizards share certain similarities in function. They are among the most offensively minded of the spellcasting classes, with a broad range of options available for neutralizing enemies. Some wizards provide great support to their comrades by way of their spells, while others may focus on divination or other facets of wizardry."
important_abilities: "Intelligence determines how powerful a spell a wizard can cast, how many spells she can cast, and how hard those spells are to resist (see Spells, below). A high Dexterity score is helpful for a wizard, who typically wears little or no armor, because it provides her with a bonus to Armor Class. A good Constitution score gives a wizard extra hit points, a resource that she is otherwise very low on. "
