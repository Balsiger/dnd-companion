  description: "The compassion to pursue good, the will to uphold law, and the\npower to defeat evil \342\200\224 these are the three weapons of the paladin.\nFew have the purity and devotion that it takes to walk the paladin\342\200\231s\npath, but those few are rewarded with the power to protect, to heal,\nand to smite. In a land of scheming wizards, unholy priests,\nbloodthirsty dragons, and infernal fiends, the paladin is the final\nhope that cannot be extinguished."
  short_description: "A pure and devoted warrior."

abbreviation: "Pal"
adventures: "Paladins take their adventures seriously and have a\npenchant for referring to them as quests. Even a mundane mission\nis, in the heart of the paladin, a personal test\342\200\224an opportunity to\ndemonstrate bravery, to develop martial skills, to learn tactics, and to\nfind ways to do good. Still, the paladin really comes into her own\nwhen leading a mighty campaign against evil, not when merely\nlooting ruins."
characteristics: "Divine power protects the paladin and gives her\nspecial powers. It wards off harm, protects her from disease, lets her\nheal herself, and guards her heart against fear. The paladin can also\ndirect this power to help others, healing their wounds or curing\ndiseases. Finally, the paladin can use this power to destroy evil. Even\nthe least experienced paladin can detect evil, and more experienced\npaladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead. In addition, this\npower draws a mighty steed to the paladin and imbues that mount\nwith strength, intelligence, and magical protection."
alignment_options: "Paladins must be lawful good, and they lose their\ndivine powers if they deviate from that alignment. Additionally,\npaladins swear to follow a code of conduct that is in line with lawfulness and goodness."
religion: "Paladins need not devote themselves to a\nsingle deity\342\200\224devotion to righteousness is enough. Those\nwho align themselves with particular religions prefer\nHeironeous (god of valor) over all others, but some paladins\nfollow Pelor (the sun god). Paladins devoted to a god are\nscrupulous in observing religious duties and are welcome in\nevery associated temple."
background: "No one ever chooses to be a paladin.\nBecoming a paladin is answering a call, accepting one\342\200\231s\ndestiny. No one, no matter how diligent, can become a\npaladin through practice. The nature is either within\none or not, and it is not possible to gain the paladin\342\200\231s\nnature by any act of will. It is possible, however, to fail\nto recognize one\342\200\231s own potential, or to deny one\342\200\231s\ndestiny. Occasionally, one who is called to be a paladin\ndenies that call and pursues some other life instead.\n\nMost paladins answer the call and begin training\nas adolescents. Typically, they become squires or\nassistants to experienced paladins, train for\nyears, and finally set off on their own to\nfurther the causes of good and law. Other\npaladins, however, find their calling only\nlater in life, after having pursued some\nother career. All paladins, regardless\nof background, recognize in each\nother an eternal bond that\ntranscends culture, race, and even\nreligion. Any two paladins, even\nfrom opposite sides of the world,\nconsider themselves comrades."
races: "Humans, with their\nambitious souls, make great\npaladins. Half-elves, who often\nhave human ambition, may also\nfind themselves called into\nservice as paladins. Dwarves\nare sometimes paladins, but\nbecoming a paladin may be\nhard on a dwarf because it\nmeans putting the duties of\nthe paladin\342\200\231s life before\nduties to family, clan, and king. Elf paladins are few, and they\ntend to follow quests that take them far and wide because\ntheir lawful bent puts them out of synch with life among the\nelves. Members of the other common races rarely hear the\ncall to become paladins.\n\nAmong the savage humanoids, paladins are all but\nunheard of."
otherClasses: "Even though paladins are in some ways\nset apart from others, they eagerly team up with those\nwhose skills and capabilities complement their own.\nThey work well with good and lawful clerics, and\nthey appreciate working with those who are\nbrave, honest, and committed to good. While\nthey cannot abide evil acts by their\ncompanions, they are otherwise willing to\nwork with a variety of people quite different\nfrom themselves. Charismatic, trustworthy, and\nwell respected, the paladin makes a fine leader\nfor a team."
role: "The paladin\342\200\231s chief role in most\ngroups is as a melee combatant, but she\ncontributes other useful support as well. She\nmakes a good secondary healer, and her high\nCharisma opens up fine leadership opportunities."
important_abilities: "Charisma enhances a paladin\342\200\231s\nhealing, self-protective capabilities, and\nundead turning ability. Strength is\nimportant for a paladin because of its\nrole in combat. A Wisdom score of\n14 or higher is required to get\naccess to the most powerful\npaladin spells, and a score of 11 or\nhigher is required to cast any\npaladin spells at all.\n\n\nConcentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal\n(Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int),\nKnowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), and Sense\nMotive (Wis)."
