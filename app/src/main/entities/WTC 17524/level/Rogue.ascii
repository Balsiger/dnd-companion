  description: "Rogues share little in common with each other. Some are stealthy thieves. Others are silver-tongued tricksters. Still others are scouts, infiltrators, spies, diplomats, or thugs. What they share is versatility, adaptability, and resourcefulness. In general, rogues are skilled at getting what others don\342\200\231t want them to get: entrance into a locked treasure vault, safe passage past a deadly trap, secret battle plans, a guard\342\200\231s trust, or some random person\342\200\231s pocket money."

abbreviation: "Rog"
adventures: "Rogues adventure for the same reason they do most things: to get what they can get. Some are after loot; others want experience. Some crave fame; others seek infamy. Quite a few also enjoy a challenge. Figuring out how to thwart a trap or avoid an alarm is great fun for many rogues."
characteristics: "Rogues are highly skilled, and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. While not equal to members of many other classes in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack.\n\nRogues have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop mystical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, rogues can \342\200\234fake it\342\200\235 well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item."
alignment_options: "Rogues follow opportunity, not ideals. They are more likely to be chaotic than lawful, they are a diverse bunch, so they may be of any alignment."
religion: "Although they are not renowned for their piety, most rogues revere Olidammara (god of thieves). Evil rogues might secretly worship Nerull (god of death), or Erythnul (god of slaughter). Since rogues are so diverse, however, many of them worship other deities, or none at all."
background: "Some rogues are officially inducted into an\n\norganized fellowship of rogues or \342\200\234guild of thieves.\342\200\235 Some are self- taught; others learned their skills from independent mentors. Often,\n\nan experienced rogue needs an assistant for scams, second-story jobs, or just for watching her back. She recruits a likely youngster, who then learns the skills of the trade on the job. Eventually, the trainee is ready to move on, perhaps because the mentor has run afoul of the law, or perhaps because the trainee has double-crossed her mentor and needs some \342\200\234space.\342\200\235\n\nRogues do not see each other as fellows unless they happen to be members of the same guild or students of the same mentor. In fact, rogues trust other rogues less than they trust anyone else. They\342\200\231re no fools."
races: "Adaptable and often unprincipled, humans take to the rogue\342\200\231s life with ease. Halflings, elves, and half-elves also find themselves well suited to the demands of the career. Dwarf and gnome rogues, while less common, are renowned as experts with locks and traps. Half-orc rogues tend toward thuggery.\n\nRogues are common among brutal humanoids, especially goblins and bugbears. Rogues who learn their arts in savage lands, however, generally don\342\200\231t have much experience with complex mechanisms such as traps and locks."
otherClasses: "Rogues love and hate working with members of other classes. They excel when protected by warriors and supported by spellcasters. There are plenty of times, however, that they wish everyone else was as quiet, guileful, and patient as they. Rogues are particularly wary of paladins, so they endeavor to prove themselves useful when contact with paladins is unavoidable."
role: "The rogue\342\200\231s role in a group can vary dramatically based on her skill selection\342\200\224from charismatic con artist to cunning burglar to agile combatant\342\200\224but most rogues share certain aspects. They aren\342\200\231t capable of prolonged melee combat, so they focus on opportunistic sneak attacks or ranged attacks. The rogue\342\200\231s stealth and her trapfinding ability make her one of the best scouts in the game."
important_abilities: "Dexterity provides extra protection for the lightly armored rogue. Dexterity, Intelligence and Wisdom are important for many of the rogue\342\200\231s skills. A high Intelligence score also gives the rogue extra skill points, which can be used to expand her repertoire."
