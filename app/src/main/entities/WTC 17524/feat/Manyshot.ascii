}
type: GENERAL
benefit: "As a standard action, you may fire two arrows at a single\n                    opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same attack\n                    roll (with a \342\200\232\303\204\303\2544 penalty) to determine success and deal\n                    damage normally (but see Special).\n\n                    For every five points of base attack bonus you have above\n                    +6, you may add one additional arrow to this attack, to a\n                    maximum of four arrows at a base attack bonus of\n                    +16. However, each arrow after the second adds a\n                    cumulative \342\200\232\303\204\303\2542 penalty on the attack roll (for a total\n                    penalty of \342\200\232\303\204\303\2546 for three arrows and \342\200\232\303\204\303\2548 for four).\n\n                    Damage reduction and other resistances apply separately\n                    against each arrow fired."
special: "Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply\n                    precision-based damage (such as sneak attack damage) only\n                    once. If you score a critical hit, only the first arrow\n                    fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular\n                    damage.\n\n                    A fighter may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus\n                    feats (see page 38).\n\n                    A 6th-level ranger who has chosen the archery combat style\n                    is treated as having Manyshot even if he does not have the\n                    prerequisites for it, but only when he is wearing light or\n                    no armor (see page 48)."
