benefit: "You can create a wand of any 4th-level or lower spell that\n                    you know. Crafting a wand takes one day for each 1,000 gp\n                    in its base price. The base price of a wand is its caster\n                    level \342\210\232\303\263 the spell level \342\210\232\303\263 750 gp. To craft a wand, you must\n                    spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw\n                    materials costing one-half of this base price. A newly\n                    created wand has 50 charges.\n\n                    Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material\n                    component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate\n                    cost. In addition to the cost derived from the base price,\n                    you must expend fifty copies of the material component or\n                    pay fifty times the XPcost."
