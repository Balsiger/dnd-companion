  short_description: "Catch a deflected ranged attack"
}
type: FIGHTER
benefit: "When using the Deflect Arrows feat (page 93), you may catch the weapon instead of just deflecting it. Thrown weapons, such as spears or axes, can immediately be thrown back at the original attacker (even though it isn't your turn) or kept for later use. \n\nYou must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this feat."
special: "A fighter may select Snatch Arrows as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38)."
prerequisites: "Dex 15, Deflect Arrows, Improved Unarmed Strike."
