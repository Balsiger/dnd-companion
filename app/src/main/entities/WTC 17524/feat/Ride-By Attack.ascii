benefit: "When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may\n                    move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move\n                    again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your\n                    total movement for the round can\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t exceed double your\n                    mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack\n                    of opportunity from the opponent that you attack."
