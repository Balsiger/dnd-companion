type: GENERAL
benefit: "You can draw a weapon as a free action instead of as a\n                    move action. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the Sleight\n                    of Hand skill, page 81) as a move action.\n\n                    A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at\n                    his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with\n                    a bow)."
special: "A fighter may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter\n                    bonus feats (see page 38)."
normal: "Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action,\n                    or (if your bStun opponent with unarmed strikease attack\n                    bonus is +1 or higher) as a free\n                    action as part of movement (see page 142). Without this\n                    feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action."
prerequisites: "Base attack bonus +1."
