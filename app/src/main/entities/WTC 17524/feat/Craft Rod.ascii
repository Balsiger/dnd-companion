benefit: "You can create any rod whose prerequisites you meet (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for prerequisites and other information on rods). Crafting a rod takes one day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To craft a rod, you must spend 1/25 of its base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half of its base price. \n\nSome rods incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions. These costs are in addition to those derived from the rod 's base price."
prerequisites: "Caster level 9th."
