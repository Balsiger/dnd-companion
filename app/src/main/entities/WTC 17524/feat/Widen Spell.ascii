type: METAMAGIC
benefit: "You Can Alter A Burst, Emanation, Line, Or Spread Shaped Spell To Increase Its Area. Any Numeric Measurements Of The Spell's area increase by 100%. For example, a fireball spell (which normally produces a 20-foot-radius spread) that is widened now fills a 40-foot Radius Spread. A Widened Spell Uses Up A Spell Slot Three Levels Higher Than The Spell's Actual Level. \n\nSpells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat."
