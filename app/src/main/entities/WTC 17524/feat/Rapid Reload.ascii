  description: "Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy). You can reload a crossbow of that type more quickly than normal."
  short_description: "Reload crossbow more quickly"
}
type: FIGHTER
benefit: "The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.  If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow."
special: "You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.  A fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38)."
normal: "A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a fullround action to reload a heavy crossbow."
prerequisites: "Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen)."
