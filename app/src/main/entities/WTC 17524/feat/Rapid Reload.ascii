  description: "Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy). You can reload a crossbow\n  of that type more quickly than normal."
  short_description: "Reload crossbow more quickly"
}
type: GENERAL
benefit: "The time required for you to reload your chosen type of\n                    crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light\n                    crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow).\n                    Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of oppor-\n                    tunity.  If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow\n                    or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times\n                    in a full attack action as you could attack if you were\n                    using a bow."
special: "You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you\n                    take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.  A\n                    fighter may select Rapid Reload as one of his fighter bonus\n                    feats (see page 38)."
normal: "A character with- out this feat needs a move action to\n                    reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full- round action to\n                    reload a heavy crossbow."
prerequisites: "Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen)."
