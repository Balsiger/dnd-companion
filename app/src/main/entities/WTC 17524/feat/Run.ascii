type: GENERAL
benefit: "When run- ning, you move five times your normal speed (if\n                    wearing medium, light, or no armor and carry- ing no more\n                    than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing\n                    heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump\n                    after a running start (see the Jump skill des- cription,\n                    page 77), you gain a +4 bonus on your Jump check. While\n                    run- ning, you retain your Dex- terity bonus to AC."
