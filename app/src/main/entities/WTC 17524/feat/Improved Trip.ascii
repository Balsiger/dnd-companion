}
type: FIGHTER
benefit: "You do not provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent while you are unarmed. You also gain a +4 bonus on your Strength check to trip your opponent. \n\nIf you trip an opponent in melee combat, you immediately get a melee attack against that opponent as if you hadn't used your attack for the trip attempt. For example, at 11th level, Tordek gets three attacks at bonuses of +11, +6, and +1. In the current round, he attempts to trip his opponent. His first attempt fails (using up his first attack). His second attempt succeeds, and he immediately makes a melee attack against his opponent with a bonus of +6. \n\nFinally, he takes his last attack at a bonus of +1."
special: "At 6th level, a monk may select Improved Trip as a bonus feat, even if she does not have the prerequisites. \n\nA fighter may select Improved Trip as one of his fighter bonus feats (see page 38)."
normal: "Without this feat, you provoke an attack of opportunity when you attempt to trip an opponent while you are unarmed. See Trip, page 158."
prerequisites: "Int 13, Combat Expertise."
