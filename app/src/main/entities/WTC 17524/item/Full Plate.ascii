  description: "This armor consists of shaped and fitted metal plates riveted and\n  interlocked to cover the entire body. The suit includes gauntlets, heavy\n  leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn\n  underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body,\n  so full plate hampers movement less than splint mail even though splint is\n  lighter. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by\n  a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new\n  owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4 \342\210\232\303\211\302\254\303\263 100) gold pieces."
