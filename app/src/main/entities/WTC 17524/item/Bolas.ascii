  description: "A set of bolas consists of two or three heavy wooden spheres connected by lengths of cord. Because the bolas can wrap around an enemy\'s leg or other limb, you can use this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can\'t be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a set of bolas."
