  description: "This metal glove protects your hands and lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes.  A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplate) come with gauntlets."
