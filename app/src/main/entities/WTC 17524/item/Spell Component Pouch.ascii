  description: "This small, watertight leather belt pouch has many compartments. A\n  spellcaster with a spell component pouch is assumed to have all the material\n  components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components\n  that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that\n  wouldn\'t fit in a pouch (such as the natural pool that a druid\n  needs to look into to cast scrying)."
