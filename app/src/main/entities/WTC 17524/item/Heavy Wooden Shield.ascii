  description: "You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy\n  shield is so heavy that you can\'t use your shield hand for anything else.\n\n  \\emph{Wooden or Steel:} Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic\n  protection, though they respond differently to special attacks (such as warp\n  wood and heat metal).\n\n  \\emph{Shield Bash Attacks:} You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield,\n  using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table 7\342\210\232\302\242\302\254\303\204\302\254\303\2545: Weapons for the damage dealt\n  by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning\n  weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as\n  a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC\n  bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement\n  bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made\n  with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right."
