  description: "A whip deals nonlethal damage. It deals no damage to any creature with an\n  armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The\n  whip is treated as a melee weapon with 15-foot reach, though you\n  don\'t threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In\n  addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes\n  anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).\n\n  Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a\n  ranged weapon.\n\n  Because a whip can wrap around an enemy\'s leg or other limb, you\n  can make trip attacks with a it. If you are tripped during your own trip\n  attempt, you can drop the whip to avoid being tripped.\n\n  When using a whip, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm\n  an opponent (including the roll to keep from being disarmed if the attack\n  fails).  You can use the \\Feat{Weapon Finesse} feat to apply your Dexterity\n  modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized\n  for you, even though it isn\'t a light weapon for you."
