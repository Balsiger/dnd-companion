  description: "A spiked chain has reach, so you can strike opponents 10 feet away with it. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, it can be used against an adjacent foe.  Because the chain can wrap around an enemy\'s leg or other limb, you can make trip attacks with the chain. If you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the chain to avoid being tripped. \n\nWhen using a spiked chain, you get a +2 bonus on opposed attack rolls made to disarm an opponent (including the roll to avoid being disarmed if such an attempt fails). \n\nYou can use the \\Feat{Weapon Finesse} feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn\'t a light weapon for you."
