  description: "You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy shield is so heavy that you can\'t use your shield hand for anything else. \n\n\\emph{Wooden or Steel:} Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks (such as warp wood and heat metal). \n\n\\emph{Shield Bash Attacks:} You can bash an opponent with a heavy shield, using it as an off-hand weapon. See Table 7\342\210\232\302\242\302\254\303\204\302\254\303\2545: Weapons for the damage dealt by a shield bash. Used this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own right."
  short_description: "A heavy shield strapped to the forarm, too heavy to allow anything else to be used with that hand. Can be used for Shield Bash Attacks (1d3/1d4 damage)."
