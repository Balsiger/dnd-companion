  description: "The manacles detailed on Table 7-8: Goods and Services can bind a Medium\n  creature. A manacled creature can use the Escape Artist skill to slip free\n  (DC 30). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26).\n\n  Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points. Most manacles have locks; add\n  the cost of the lock you want to the cost of the manacles.  For the same\n  cost, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature,\n  manacles cost ten times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, one\n  hundred times this amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine\n  creatures can be held only by specially made manacles."
