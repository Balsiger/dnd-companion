  description: "A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics\n  to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature\n  to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and\n  able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the\n  creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the\n  ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he\n  can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability (two at\n  4th level, three at 7th level, and so on).  To use the ability, a bard makes\n  a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s Will\n  save against the effect. If a creature\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s saving throw succeeds, the bard\n  cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving\n  throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no\n  other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up\n  to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a\n  \342\200\232\303\204\303\2544 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot\n  checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check\n  and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new\n  Perform check result. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon,\n  casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically\n  breaks the effect.  Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting\n  ability."
