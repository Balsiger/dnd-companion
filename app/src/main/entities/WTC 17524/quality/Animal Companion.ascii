  description: "A character may begin play with an animal companion. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the character on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.\n\nAs a character advances in level, the animal\'s power increases: \n\n\\list {1-2 1 bonus tricks, Link, Share Spells;} {3-5 +2 HD, +2 natural armor, +1 Str, +1 Dex, 2 Bonus Tricks, Evasion.} {6-8 +4 HD, +4 natural armor, +2 Str, +2 Dex, 3 Bonus Tricks, Devotion;} {9-11 +6 HD, +6 natural armor, +3 Str, +3 Dex, 4 Bonus Tricks, Multiattack;} {12-14 +8 HD, +8 natural armor, +4 Str, +4 Dex, 5 Bonus Tricks;} {15-17 +10 HD, +10 natural armor, +5 Str, +5 Dex, 6 Bonus Tricks, Improved Evasion;} {18-20 +12 HD, +12 natural armor, +6 Str, +6 Dex, 7 Bonus Tricks.}\n\nIf a character releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.\n\nA druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals:\n\n\\bold{4th Level or Higher, level -3} \\list {Ape (animal)} {Bear, black (animal)} {Bison (animal)} {Boar (animal)} {Cheetah (animal)} {Crocodile (animal)} {Dire badger} {Dire bat} {Dire weasel} {Leopard (animal)} {Lizard, monitor (animal)} {Shark, large (animal)} {Snake, constrictor (animal)} {Snake, Large viper (animal)} {Wolverine (animal)}\n\n\\bold{7th Level or Higher, Level -6}\n\n\\list {Bear, brown (animal)} {Crocodile, giant (animal)} {Deinonychus (dinosaur)} {Dire ape} {Dire boar} {Dire wolf} {Dire wolverine} {Elasmosaurus (dinosaur)} {Lion (animal)} {Rhinoceros (animal)} {Snake, Huge viper (animal)} {Tiger (animal)}\n\n\\bold{10th Level or Higher, Level -9}\n\n\\list {Bear, polar (animal)} {Dire lion} {Megaraptor (dinosaur)} {Shark, Huge (animal)} {Snake, giant constrictor (animal)} {Whale, orca (animal)}\n\n\\bold{13th Level or Higher, Level -12}\n\n\\list {Dire bear} {Octopus, giant (animal)} {Elephant (animal)}\n\n\\bold{16th Level or Higher, Level -15}\n\n\\list {Dire shark} {Dire Tiger} {Squid, giant (animal)} {Triceratops (dinosaur)} {Tyrannosaurus (dinosaur)}\n\nShould she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character's druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character's druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table in the sidebar to determine the animal companion's powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid's effective level to 0 or lower, she can't have that animal as a companion.) For example, a 6th-level druid could select a leopard as an animal companion. The leopard would have characteristics and special abilities as if the druid were 3rd level (taking into account the -3 adjustment) instead of 6th level. "
