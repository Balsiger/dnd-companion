  description: "If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself\n  effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra\n  damage. Basically, the rogue\'s attack deals extra damage any time her\n  target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually\n  has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This\n  extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue\n  levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack,\n  this extra damage is not multiplied. (See Table 8-5: Attack Roll\n  Modifiers and Table 8-6: Armor Class Modifiers, page 151, for combat\n  situations in which the rogue flanks an opponent or the opponent loses his\n  Dexterity bonus to AC.)\n\n  Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30\n  feet. A rogue can\'t strike with deadly accuracy from beyond that range.\n\n  With a \\Item{sap} (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak\n  attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use\n  a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack,\n  not even with the usual \342\200\232\303\204\303\2544 penalty, because she must make optimal use\n  of her weapon in order to execute a sneak attack. (See Nonlethal Damage, page\n  146.)\n\n  A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible\n  anatomies \342\200\232\303\204\303\256 undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal\n  creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical\n  hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the\n  target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a\n  spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment\n  (see page 152) or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond\n  reach."
