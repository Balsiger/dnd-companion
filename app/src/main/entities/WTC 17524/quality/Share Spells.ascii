  description: "At the creature\'s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion or familiar. The animal companion or familiar must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion or familiar if the companion or familiar moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the creature before the duration expires.  Additionally, the creature may cast a spell with a target of \'You\' on her animal companion or familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A creature and her animal companion/familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion\'s/familiar\'s type (animal/magical beast)."
