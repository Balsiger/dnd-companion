  description: "A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can\n  make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated\n  (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s concentration on\n  the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the\n  fascinate effect. Making a suggestion doesn\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t count against a bard\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s daily\n  limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s\n  level + bard\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a\n  single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchanment\n  (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability."
