Knowledge represents a study of some body of\n  lore, possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.  Below are listed\n  typical fields of study. With your DM\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s approval, you can invent new areas of\n  knowledge.  Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols,\n  cryptic phrases, constructs, dragons, magical beasts) Architecture and\n  engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications) Dungeoneering\n  (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking) Geography (lands, terrain, climate,\n  people) History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)\n  Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, tradi- tions,\n  humanoids) Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons\n  and cycles, weather, vermin) Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family\n  trees, mottoes, personalities) Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history,\n  ecclesiastic tradi- tion, holy symbols, undead) The planes (the Inner Planes,\n  the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders,\n  elementals, magic related to the planes)"
