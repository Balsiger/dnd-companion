special: "If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3                     dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the                     usual +2 dodge bonus to AC (see Fighting Defensively, page                     140).  If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a                     +6 dodge bonus to AC when executing the total defense                     standard action instead of the usual +4 dodge bonus to AC                     (see Total Defense, page 142).  If you have the Acrobatic                     feat, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks."
