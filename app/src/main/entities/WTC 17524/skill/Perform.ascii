  description: "You are skilled in a type of artistic expression, which may encompass a variety of specific methods, and you know how to put on a show.  Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate skills. For instance, you could have the skill Perform (act). Your ranks in that skill don\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t affect any checks you happen to make for Perform (oratory) or Perform (string instruments). You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.  Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided for each category below. The DM is free to expand any of these categories with additional methods, instruments, or tech- niques, as appropriate for his or her campaign.  Act (comedy, drama, mime) Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling) Dance (ballet, waltz, jig) Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ) Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling) Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong) String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin) Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet) Sing (ballad, chant, melody)"
