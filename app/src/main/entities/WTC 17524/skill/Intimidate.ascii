ability: CHARISMA
action: "Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 minute of                     interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a                     standard action."
special: "You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every                     size category that you are larger than your                     target. Conversely, you take a -4 penalty on your                     Intimidate check for every size category that you are                     smaller than your target.  A character immune to fear                     (such as a paladin of 3rd level or higher) can't be                     intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.  If you                     have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate                     checks."
