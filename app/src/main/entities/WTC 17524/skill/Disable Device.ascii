  description: "Use this skill to disarm a trap, jam a lock (in either the open or closed position), or rig a wagon wheel to fall off. You can examine a fairly simple or fairly small mechanical device and disable it. The effort requires at least a simple tool of the appropriate sort (a pick, pry bar, saw, file, etc.). Attempting a Disable Device check without a set of thieves' tools (page 130) carries a -2 circumstance penalty, even if a simple tool is employed. The use of masterwork thieves' tools enables you to make the check with a +2 circumstance bonus."

action: "The amount of time needed to make a Disable Device check                     depends on the task, as noted above. Disabling a simple                     device takes 1 round and is a full-round action. An                     intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds."
special: "If you have the Nimble Fingers feat, you get a +2 bonus                     on Disable Device checks.  A rogue who beats a trap's DC                     by 10 or more can study the trap, figure out how it works,                     and bypass it (along with her companions) without                     disarming it."
restriction_text: "Rogues (and other characters with the trapfinding class                     feature) can disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally                     has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to                     create it. For instance, disarming a trap set by the                     casting of explosive runes has a AC of 28 because                     explosive runes is a 3rd-level spell.  The spells fire                     trap, glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle                     also create traps that a rogue can disarm with a                     successful Disable Device check. Spike growth and spike                     stones, however, create magic traps against which Disable                     Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell                     descriptions in Chapter 11: Spells for details."
