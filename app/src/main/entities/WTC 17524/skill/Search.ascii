  description: "You can find secret doors, simple traps, hidden compartments, and other details not readily apparent. The Spot skill lets you notice something, such as a hiding rogue. The Search skill lets a character discern some small detail or irregularity through active effort.\n\nSearch does not allow you to find complex traps unless you are a rogue (see Restriction, below)."

ability: INTELLIGENCE
action: "It takes a full-round action to search a 5-foot-by-5-foot                     area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side."
special: "An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Search checks, and a                     half- elf has a +1 racial bonus. An elf (but not a                     half-elf) who simply passes within 5 feet of a secret or                     concealed door can make a Search check to find that door.                     If you have the Investigator feat, you get a +2 bonus on                     Search checks.  The spells explosive runes, fire trap,                     glyph of warding, symbol, and teleportation circle create                     magic traps that a rogue can find by making a successful                     Search check and then can attempt to disarm by using                     Disable Device. Identifying the location of a snare spell                     has a DC of 23. Spike growth and spike stones create magic                     traps that can be found using Search, but against which                     Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual                     spell descriptions in Chapter 11: Spells for details.                     Active abjuration spells within 10 feet of each other for                     24 hours or more create barely visible energy                     fluctuations. These fluctuations give you a +4 bonus on                     Search checks to locate such abjuration spells."
restriction_text: "While anyone can use Search to find a trap whose DC is 20                     or lower, only a rogue can use Search to locate traps with                     higher DCs. (Exception: The spell find traps temporarily                     enables a cleric to use the Search skill as if he were a                     rogue.)  A dwarf, even one who is not a rogue, can use the                     Search skill to find a difficult trap (one with a DC                     higher than 20) if the trap is built into or out of                     stone. He gains a +2 racial bonus on the Search check from                     his stonecunning ability."
