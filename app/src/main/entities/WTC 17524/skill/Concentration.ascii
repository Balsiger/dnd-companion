check: "You must make a Concentration check whenever you might\n                     potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh\n                     weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that\n                     requires your full attention. Such actions include casting\n                     a spell, concentrating on an active spell (such as detect\n                     magic), directing a spell (such as spiritual weapon),\n                     using a spell-like ability (such as a paladin\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s remove\n                     disease ability), or using a skill that would provoke an\n                     attack of opportunity (such as Disable Device, Heal, Open\n                     Lock, and Use Rope, among others). In general, if an\n                     action wouldn\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t normally provoke an attack of opportunity,\n                     you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being\n                     distracted.  If the Concentration check succeeds, you may\n                     continue with the action as normal. If the check fails,\n                     the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were\n                     in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost (see\n                     Cast a Spell, page 140). If you were concentrating on an\n                     active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased\n                     concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the\n                     direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were\n                     using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is\n                     lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed\n                     skill check may have other ramifications as well.  The\n                     table below summarizes various types of distractions that\n                     cause you to make a Concentration check. If the\n                     distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell,\n                     you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast\n                     to the appropriate Concentration DC (See Concentration,\n                     page 170, for more information). If more than one type of\n                     distraction is present, make a check for each one; any\n                     failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not\n                     completed.

(You\n                     can cast only spells without somatic components for which\n                     you have any required material component in hand.)  5\n                     Weather is a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet.\n                     10 Weather is wind-driven hail, dust, or debris.\n                     Distracting spell\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s Weather caused by a spell, such as\n                     storm of save DC vengeance.4 1 If you are trying to cast,\n                     concentrate on, or direct a spell when the distraction\n                     occurs, add the level of the spell to the indicated DC.  2\n                     Such as during the casting of a spell with a casting time\n                     of 1 round or more, or the execution of an activity that\n                     takes more than a single full- round action (such as\n                     Disable Device). Also, damage stemming from an attack of\n                     opportunity or readied attack made in response to the\n                     spell being cast (for spells with a casting time of 1\n                     action) or the action being taken (for activities\n                     requiring no more than a full-round action). (See also\n                     Distracting Spellcasters, page 160.)  3 Such as from\n                     Melf\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s acid arrow.  4 If the spell allows no save, use the\n                     save DC it would have if it did allow a save."
action: "None. Making a Concentration check doesn\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t take an\n                     action; it is either a free action (when attempted\n                     reactively) or part of another action (when attempted\n                     actively)."
special: "You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a\n                     spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to\n                     avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. This doesn\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t\n                     apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of\n                     opportunity (such as movement or loading a crossbow).  The\n                     DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s level, if casting\n                     a spell or using a spell-like ability defensively). If the\n                     Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action\n                     normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. A\n                     successful Concentration check still doesn\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t allow you to\n                     take 10 on another check if you are in a stressful\n                     situation; you must make the check normally. If the\n                     Concentration check fails, the related action also\n                     automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications),\n                     and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration\n                     had been disrupted by a distraction.  A character with the\n                     Combat Casting feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration\n                     checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability\n                     while on the defensive (see page 140) or while grappling\n                     or pinned."
