ability: STRENGTH
action: "None. A Jump check is included in your movement, so it is                     part of a move action. If you run out of movement                     mid-jump, your next action (either on this turn or, if                     necessary, on your next turn) must be a move action to                     complete the jump."
special: "Effects that increase your movement also increase your                     jumping distance, since your check is modified by your                     speed.  If you have the Run feat, you get a +4 bonus on                     Jump checks for any jumps made after a running start.  A                     halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Jump checks because                     halflings are agile and athletic.  If you have the                     Acrobatic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Jump checks."
