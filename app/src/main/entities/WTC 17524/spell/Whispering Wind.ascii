  description: "You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The whispering\n  wind travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you,\n  provided that it can find a way to the location. (It can\'t pass through\n  walls, for instance.) A whispering wind is as gentle and unnoticed as a\n  zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet\n  message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of\n  whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates. You can\n  prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause\n  the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the whispering\n  wind seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the\n  whispering wind to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile\n  per 10 minutes. When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains\n  in place until the message is delivered. As with magic mouth, whispering wind\n  cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical\n  effects."
