  description: "This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6x10 minutes. Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. ote: Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it.\n\nThe DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep.\n\nMaterial Component: Mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp."
