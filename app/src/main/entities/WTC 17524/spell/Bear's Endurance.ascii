  description: "The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are (see page 146 of the \\Product[WTC 17524]{Player\'s Handbook})."
