  description: "Erase removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or\n  from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this\n  spell, you can remove explosive runes, a glyph of warding, a sepia snake\n  sigil, or an arcane mark, but not illusory script or a symbol\n  spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one\n  else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is\n  90%.  Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed\n  on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or\n  2 is always a failure on this check.) If you fail to erase explosive runes, a\n  glyph of warding, or a sepia snake sigil, you accidentally activate that\n  writing instead."
