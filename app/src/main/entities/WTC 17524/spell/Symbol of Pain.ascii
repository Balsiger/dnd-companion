  description: "This spell functions like symbol of death, except that each creature within\n  the radius of a symbol of pain instead suffers wracking pains that impose a\n  \342\200\232\303\204\303\2544 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks.  These effects\n  last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the\n  symbol.  Unlike symbol of death, symbol of pain has no hit point limit; once\n  triggered, a symbol of pain simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster\n  level.  Note: Magic traps such as symbol of pain are hard to detect and\n  disable. A rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of pain and\n  Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30\n  for symbol of pain.  Material Component: Mercury and phosphorus, plus\n  powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp."
