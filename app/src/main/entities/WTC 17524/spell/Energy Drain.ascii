  description: "This spell functions like enervation, except that the creature struck gains\n2d4 negative levels, and the negative levels last longer.  There is no saving\nthrow to avoid gaining the negative levels, but 24 hours after gaining them,\nthe subject must make a Fortitude saving throw (DC = energy drain spell\'s\nsave DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that negative level\nis removed. If it fails, the negative level also goes away, but one of the\nsubject\'s character levels is permanently drained.  An undead creature struck\nby the ray gains 2d4 +5 temporary hit points for 1 hour."
