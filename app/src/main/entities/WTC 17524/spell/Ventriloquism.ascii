  description: "You can make your voice (or any sound that you can normally make vocally)\n  seem to issue from someplace else, such as from another creature, a statue,\n  from behind a door, down a passage, etc. You can speak in any language you\n  know. With respect to such voices and sounds, anyone who hears the sound and\n  rolls a successful save recognizes it as illusory (but still hears it).\n  Focus: A parchment rolled up into a small cone."
