  description: "Any creature within the area that fails a Will save becomes drowsy and inattentive, taking a \342\200\232\303\204\303\2545 penalty on Listen and Spot checks and a \342\200\232\303\204\303\2542 penalty on Will saves against sleep effects while the lullaby is in effect. Lullaby lasts for as long as the caster concentrates, plus up to 1 round per caster level thereafter."
