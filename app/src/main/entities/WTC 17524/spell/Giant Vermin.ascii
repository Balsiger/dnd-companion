  description: "You turn three normal-sized centipedes, two normal-sized spiders, or a\n  single normal-sized scorpion into larger forms.  Only one type of vermin can\n  be transmuted (so a single casting cannot affect both a centipede and a\n  spider), and all must be grown to the same size. The size to which the vermin\n  can be grown depends on your level; see the table below. The Monster Manual\n  has game statistics for centipedes, spiders, and scorpions, as well as other\n  kinds of vermin.  Any giant vermin created by this spell do not attempt to\n  harm you, but your control of such creatures is limited to simple commands\n  (\342\200\232\303\204\303\272Attack,\342\200\232\303\204\303\271 \342\200\232\303\204\303\272Defend,\342\200\232\303\204\303\271 \342\200\232\303\204\303\272Stop,\342\200\232\303\204\303\271 and so forth). Orders to attack a certain\n  creature when it appears or guard against a particular occurrence are too\n  complex for the vermin to understand. Unless commanded to do otherwise, the\n  giant vermin attack whoever or whatever is near them.  The DM can extend this\n  spell\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s effects to other kinds of insects, arachnids, or other vermin, such\n  as ants, bees, beetles, praying mantises, and wasps, if he so chooses.\n  Caster Level Vermin Size 9th or lower Medium 10th\342\200\232\303\204\303\25413th Large 14th\342\200\232\303\204\303\25417th Huge\n  18th\342\200\232\303\204\303\25419th Gargantuan 20th or higher Colossal"
