  description: "This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A knock spell or a successful dispel magic spell can negate a hold portal spell.  For a portal affected by this spell, add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open the portal."
