  description: "You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any\n  suitable writing material. The illusory script appears to be some form of\n  foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at\n  the time of the casting are able to read the writing; it\'s unintelligible to\n  any other character, although an illusionist recognizes it as illusory\n  script.  Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a\n  potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving\n  throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of\n  disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion\n  implanted in the script by you at the time the illusory script spell was\n  cast. The suggestion lasts only 30 minutes. Typical suggestions include\n  \342\200\232\303\204\303\272Close the book and leave,\342\200\232\303\204\303\271 \342\200\232\303\204\303\272Forget the existence of the book,\342\200\232\303\204\303\271 and so\n  forth. If successfully dispelled by dispel magic, the illusory script and its\n  secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of\n  the true seeing spell with the read magic or comprehend languages spell.  The\n  casting time depends on how long a message you wish to write, but it is\n  always at least 1 minute.  Material Component: A lead-based ink (cost of not\n  less than 50 gp)."
