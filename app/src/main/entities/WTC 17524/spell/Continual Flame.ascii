  description: "A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered and hidden but not smothered or quenched.\n\nLight spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an equal or lower level.\n\nMaterial Component: You sprinkle ruby dust (worth 50 gp) on the item that is to carry the flame."
