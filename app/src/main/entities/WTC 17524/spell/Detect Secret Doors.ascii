  description: "You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell - an ordinary trapdoor underneath a pile of crates would not be detected. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.\n\n1st Round: Presence or absence of secret doors.\n\n2nd Round: Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.\n\nEach Additional Round: The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you.\n\nEach round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it."
