  description: "This spell enables you to control the actions of one or more plant creatures for a short period of time. You command the creatures by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak.\n\nEven if vocal communication is impossible (in the area of a silence spell, for instance), the controlled plants do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior.\n\nSuicidal or self-destructive commands are simply ignored.\n\nContact Other Plane Avoid Int/Cha True Don't Random Plane Contacted Decrease Answer Know Lie Answer Elemental Plane DC 7/1 week 01-34 35-62 63-83 84-100 (appropriate) (DC 7/1 week) (01-68) (69-75) (76-98) (99-100) Positive/Negative Energy Plane DC 8/1 week 01-39 40-65 66-86 87-100 Astral Plane DC 9/1 week 01-44 45-67 68-88 89-100 Outer Plane, demideity DC 10/2 weeks 01-49 50-70 71-91 92-100 Outer Plane, lesser deity DC 12/3 weeks 01-60 61-75 76-95 96-100 Outer Plane, intermediate deity DC 14/4 weeks 01-73 74-81 82-98 99-100 Outer Plane, greater deity DC 16/5 weeks 01-88 89-90 91-99 100 Avoid Int/Cha Decrease: You must succeed on an Intelligence check against this DC to avoid a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma. If the check fails, your Intelligence and Charisma scores each fall to 8 for the stated duration, and you become unable to cast arcane spells. If you lose Intelligence and Charisma, the effect strikes as soon as the first question is asked, and no answer is received.\n\n(The entries in parentheses are for questions that pertain to the appropriate Elemental Plane.)\n\nResults of a Successful Contact: d% is rolled for the result shown on the table: True Answer: You get a true, one-word answer. Questions that cannot be answered in this way are answered randomly.\n\nDon't Know: The entity tells you that it doesn't know.\n\nLie: The entity intentionally lies to you.\n\nRandom Answer: The entity tries to lie but doesn't know the answer, so it makes one up."
