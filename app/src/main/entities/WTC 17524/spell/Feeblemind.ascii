  description: "If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1, giving it roughly the intellect of a lizard. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charismabased skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently.\n\nStill, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel the effect of the feeblemind. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a -4 penalty on its saving throw."
