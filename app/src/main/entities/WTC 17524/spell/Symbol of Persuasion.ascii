  description: "This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures within\n  the radius of a symbol of persuasion instead become charmed by the caster (as\n  the charm monster spell) for 1 hour per caster level.  Unlike symbol of\n  death, symbol of persuasion has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol\n  of persuasion simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  Note:\n  Magic traps such as symbol of persuasion are hard to detect and disable. A\n  rogue (only) can use the Search skill to find a symbol of persuasion and\n  Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31\n  for symbol of persuasion.  Material Component: Mercury and phosphorus, plus\n  powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 5,000 gp."
