  description: "You can see and hear some creature, which may be at any distance. If the\n  subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt simply fails. The\n  difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort\n  of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if\n  the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save.\n  Knowledge Will Save Modifier None1 +10 Secondhand (you have heard +5 of the\n  subject) Firsthand (you have met the subject) +0 Familiar (you know the\n  subject well) \342\200\232\303\204\303\2545 1 You must have some sort of connection to a creature you\n  have no knowledge of.  Connection Will Save Modifier Likeness or picture \342\200\232\303\204\303\2542\n  Possession or garment \342\200\232\303\204\303\2544 Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, etc. \342\200\232\303\204\303\25410 If\n  the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and the subject\'s immediate\n  surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the\n  subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet.  As with all\n  divination (scrying) spells, the sensor has your full visual acuity,\n  including any magical effects. In addition, the following spells have a 5%\n  chance per caster level of operating through the sensor: detect chaos, detect\n  evil, detect good, detect law, detect magic, and message.  If the save\n  succeeds, you can\'t attempt to scry on that subject again for at least 24\n  hours.  Arcane Material Component: The eye of a hawk, an eagle, or a roc,\n  plus nitric acid, copper, and zinc.  Wizard, Sorcerer, or Bard Focus: A\n  mirror of finely wrought and highly polished silver costing not less than\n  1,000 gp. The mirror must be at least 2 feet by 4 feet.  Cleric Focus: A holy\n  water font costing not less than 100 gp.  Druid Focus: A natural pool of\n  water."
