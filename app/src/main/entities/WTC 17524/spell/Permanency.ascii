The DM may allow other selected spells to be made\n  permanent. Researching this possible application of a spell costs as much\n  time and money as independently researching the selected spell (see the\n  Dungeon Master\'s Guide for details). If the DM has already determined that\n  the application is not possible, the research automatically fails. Note that\n  you never learn what is possible except by the success or failure of your\n  research.  XP Cost: See tables above."
