  description: "This spell enables you to command undead creatures for a short period of time. You command them by voice and they understand you, no matter what language you speak. Even if vocal communication is impossible (in the area of a silence spell, for instance), the controlled undead do not attack you. At the end of the spell, the subjects revert to their normal behavior. Intelligent undead creatures remember that you controlled them.\n\nMaterial Component: A small piece of bone and a small piece of raw meat."
