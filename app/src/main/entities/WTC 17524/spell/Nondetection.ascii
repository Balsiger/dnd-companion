  description: "The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination\n  spells such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and detect\n  spells. Nondetection also prevents location by such magic items as crystal\n  balls.  If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the\n  caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster\n  level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast\n  nondetection. If you cast nondetection on yourself or on an item currently in\n  your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.  If cast on a creature,\n  nondetection wards the creature\'s gear as well as the creature itself.\n  Material Component: A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp."
