  description: "Shatter creates a loud, ringing noise that breaks brittle, nonmagical\n  objects; sunders a single solid, nonmagical object; or damages a crystalline\n  creature.  Used as an area attack, shatter destroys nonmagical objects of\n  crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain, such as vials, bottles, flasks, jugs,\n  windows, mirrors, and so forth.  All such objects within a 5-foot radius of\n  the point of origin are smashed into dozens of pieces by the spell. Objects\n  weighing more than 1 pound per your level are not affected, but all other\n  objects of the appropriate composition are shattered.  Alternatively, you can\n  target shatter against a single solid object, regardless of composition,\n  weighing up to 10 pounds per caster level.  Targeted against a crystalline\n  creature (of any weight), shatter deals 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster\n  level (maximum 10d6), with a Fortitude save for half damage.  Arcane Material\n  Component: A chip of mica."
