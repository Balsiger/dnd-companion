  description: "This spell functions like prying eyes, except that the eyes can see all things as they actually are, just as if they had true seeing with a range of 120 feet. Thus, they can navigate darkened areas at full normal speed. Also, a greater prying eye\'s maximum Spot modifier is +25 instead of +15."
