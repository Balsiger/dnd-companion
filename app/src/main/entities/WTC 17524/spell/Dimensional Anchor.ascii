  description: "A green ray springs from your outstretched hand. You must make a ranged\ntouch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is\ncovered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks\nextradimensional travel.  Forms of movement barred by a dimensional anchor\ninclude astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt,\netherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar\nspell-like or psionic abilities.  The spell also prevents the use of a gate\nor teleportation circle for the duration of the spell.  A dimensional anchor\ndoes not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or\nastral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional\nperception or attack forms, such as a basilisk\'s gaze. Also, dimensional\nanchor does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a\nsummoning spell."
