  description: "\\emph{The words of your spell twist upon each other and grow stronger. Then, like a cluster of bees, they streak toward your target and detonate in a screaming bellow around him.}\\par You blast the target with loud and high-pitched sounds. The subject takes 1d4 points of sonic damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d4) and must make a Will save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. This spell has no effect if cast into the area of a \\Spell{silence} spell."
