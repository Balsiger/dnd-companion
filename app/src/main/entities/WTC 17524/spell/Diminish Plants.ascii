  description: "This spell has two versions.\n\nPrune Growth: This version causes normal vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, hedges, thistles, trees, vines, and so forth) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to shrink to about one-third of their normal size, becoming untangled and less bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and trimmed.\n\nAt your option, the area can be a 100foot-radius circle, a 150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle.\n\nYou may also designate portions of the area that are not affected.\n\nStunt Growth: This version targets normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their potential productivity over the course of the following year to onethird below normal.\n\nDiminish plants counters plant growth.\n\nThis spell has no effect on plant creatures."
