  description: "This spell has two versions.  Prune Growth: This version causes normal\n  vegetation (grasses, briars, bushes, creepers, hedges, thistles, trees,\n  vines, and so forth) within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per level) to\n  shrink to about one-third of their normal size, becoming untangled and less\n  bushy. The affected vegetation appears to have been carefully pruned and\n  trimmed.  At your option, the area can be a 100foot-radius circle, a\n  150-foot-radius semicircle, or a 200-foot-radius quarter-circle.  You may\n  also designate portions of the area that are not affected.  Stunt Growth:\n  This version targets normal plants within a range of 1/2 mile, reducing their\n  potential productivity over the course of the following year to onethird\n  below normal.  Diminish plants counters plant growth.  This spell has no\n  effect on plant creatures."
