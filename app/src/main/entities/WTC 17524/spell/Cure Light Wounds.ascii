  description: "When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy\n  that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).\n  Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them\n  instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell\n  resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage."
