  description: "Magic weapon gives a weapon a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. (An enhancement bonus does not stack with a masterwork weapon\'s +1 bonus on attack rolls.)  You can\'t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as an unarmed strike (instead, see magic fang). A monk\'s unarmed strike is considered a weapon, and thus it can be enhanced by this spell."
