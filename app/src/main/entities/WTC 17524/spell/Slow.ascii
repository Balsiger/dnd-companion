  description: "An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a \342\200\232\303\204\303\2541 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature\'s jumping distance as normal for decreased speed. Multiple slow effects don\'t stack. Slow counters and dispels haste.  Material Component: A drop of molasses."
