  description: "A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor\n  obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet\n  away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance).  Creatures farther\n  away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use\n  sight to locate the target).  A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust\n  of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph)\n  disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell\n  burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell\'s area. A wall of fire\n  burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.  This spell does\n  not function underwater."
