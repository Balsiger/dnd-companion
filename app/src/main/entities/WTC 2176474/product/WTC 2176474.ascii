  description: "At the height of \\Place{Netheril}\'s power, the fortress of \\Spell{Spellgard} held many great secrets of the \\Place{Empire of Magic}. Now only ruins remain... and on last guardian, the near mythical \\NPC{Lady Saharel}, whose prophetic visions draw the desperate and the doomed from across \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}. But a dark presence in one of \\Place{Spellgard}\'s intact towers wants to control the power of the prophecy for itself and remake the future in its own image. Designed for 2nd-level characters, \\Product{Scepter Tower of Spellgard} brings heroes to the cusp of 5th level. The adventure is set in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign setting, but is easily adaptable to any setting. This Dungeons & Dragons adventure includes a 64-page book detailing the perils of the \\Place{Spellgard} ruins; a 32-page booklet that contains advice for running the overall adventure, player handouts, and full-color illustrations of sights and scenes in the adventure; and a double-sided battle map designed for use with D&D Miniatures."
