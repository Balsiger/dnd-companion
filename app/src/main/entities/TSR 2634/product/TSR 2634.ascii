  description: "\\large{The \\Place{Prime Material Plane} is formed of solid matter. The \\Place{Outer Planes} are formed of belief. The \\Place{Inner Planes}...are.} \\emph{Beyond the \\Place{Prime}\'s infinite crystal spheres, beyond the endless realms of the \\Place{Outer Planes}, lies the absolute reality of the \\Place{Inner Planes}. The cornerstone planes of \\Place{Air}, \\Place{Earth}, \\Place{Fire}, and \\Place{Water} are the most well-known \\Place{Inner Planes}, but they\'re only the beginning. From the deadly purity of the \\Place{Positive} and \\Place{Negative Energy Planes} to the unbearable filth of the \\Place{plane of Ooze} to the eternal storm of the \\Place{plane of Lightning}, the \\Place{Elemental Planes} are the substance of existence itself. These eighteen planes form the foundation of the entire \\Place{multiverse}; they are the cauldron from which all energy and matter are brewed.} \\Product{The Inner Planes} details the \\Place{Elemental}, \\Place{Paraelemental}, \\Place{Quasielemental}, and \\Place{Energy Planes}. Surviving these planes can be a challenge, but within these pages DMs and players learn how characters can adventure among the unearthly locales and strange denizens. This planar sourcebook includes: \\list {Detailed descriptions of the environments and regions of each of the eighteen \\Place{Inner Planes.}} {Rules for movement, and combat, and survival within these strange and unique environments.} {Information about the inhabitants and ecology of each plane, including \\Monster{elementals}, \\Monster{genies}, \\Monster{mephits}, and even stranger beings.} {Interesting and important locales within the \\Place{Inner Planes}, including such diverse places as the \\Place{City of Brass} in the \\Place{plane of Fire}, the \\Place{Mountain of Ultimate Winter} in the \\Place{plane of Ice}, the \\Place{Refuge of Color} in the \\Place{plane of Radiance}, and the mysterious, aeons-old abandoned towers of the \\Place{Quasielemental Planes}.} large{Go to the extremes!}"
