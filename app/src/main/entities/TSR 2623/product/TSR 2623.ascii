  description: "\\large{The powers move in mysterious ways. At least, they did---until now}\n                    No ordinary tome can hold the powers of the planes, berk. That\'s why\n                    \\Product{On Hallowed Ground} is two books in one. In the first chapters,\n                    learn what divine compacts keep the gods from tearing the \\Place{multiverse}\n                    apart. Get the dark on turning player characters into proxies. Find out what\n                    happens when a spellslinger brings a petitioner back to life. And tumble to\n                    the awesome prestive---and awesome \\emph{danger}---of walking the\n                    \\Place{Great Ring} as a priest.\n                    The second part of \\Place{On Hallowed Ground} delivers the chant on hundreds\n                    of AD&D game powers, from \\God{Aasterinian} to \\God{Zivilyn}---and just about\n                    every high-up in between. More than a summary of old material, it updates the\n                    AD&D game\'s gods for the \\Product{Planescape} campaign setting, featuring\n                    their trusted proxies, their brash rivalries, and their hard-won roles in the\n                    cosmos.\n                    Written for Dungeon Masters and players, this 192-page, full-color book\n                    includes:\n                    \\list\n                    {20 separate pantheons detailing the powers worshiped by\n                    \\Monster{humans}, \\Monster{demihumans}, and monsters (including the\n                    deities of the AD&D game worlds). \\God{Zeus}, \\God{Sun Chiang},\n                    \\God{Gruumsh}, \\God{Takhisis}---they\'re all here, based on chant from\n                    \\Product{Legends & Lore}, the \\Product{Deities and Demigods} book,\n                    \\Product{Monster Mythology}, and AD&D game world sources.}\n                    {New ideas and rules for priest characters on the planes.}\n                    {Tips on creating, visiting, and surviving divine realms.}\n                    {A look at powers favored by factions and planewalkers.}\n                    {Comprehensive appendices listing gods by pantheon and portfolio.}\n                    {Full-color maps of realms glorious and infernal.}"
