  description: "On the side stand the followers of \\NPC{Phage}, who cry out for new arena combats, new champions, new blood spilled in the sand. On the other are the supporters of \\NPC{Akroma}, the \\Monster{angel}, who preaches a terrifying religion hallowing her creator. In the middle stands the lonely figure of \\NPC{Kamahl}. Once a champion of the pits, he must now atone for the terrible wrongs he has wrought. Those wrongs gave birth to \\NPC{Phage} and \\NPC{Akroma}. They gave birth to the suffering of the world. Now \\NPC{Kamahl} must sweep the land clean of this terrible blight. But his fury may destroy that which he most loves."
