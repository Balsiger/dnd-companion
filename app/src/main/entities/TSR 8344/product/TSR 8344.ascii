  description: "The tempestuous affair of \\NPC{Kitiara Uth Matar} and \\NPC{Tanis Half-Elven}\n  begins with the sword.\n\n  Life isn\'t simple for the hotheaded pair. They must contend with a\n  carnivorous, two-headed \\Monster{troll}; a deposed leader who believes\n  \\NPC{Kitiara} is the cause of the ruler\'s troubles; a vindictive \\Class{mage}\n  who seeks peculiar vengeance; and \\NPC{Kit}\'s hulking former lover. They also\n  meet a beautiful \\Class{magic}-user hiding a painful secret, and a\n  \\Monster{giant owl} with a sardonic sense of humor.\n\n  Here is the long-awaited story of the meeting of \\NPC{Tanis} and\n  \\NPC{Kitiara}, a tale of love, lust, betrayal, and revenge that takes the\n  reader through \\Place{Krynn} and south to the glacial \\Place{Icereach}.\n\n  Ellen Porath, co-author of \\Product{Kindred Spirits}, tells this exciting new\n  tale, the fifth in the \\Product{Dragonlance Saga Meetings Sextet}."
