Taken straight from D&D rulebooks, such as the \\Product{Draconomicon}, \\Product{Complete Warrior}, \\Product{Miniatures Handbook}, and the \\Product{Dragonlance Campaign Setting}, these characters are ready for battle -- right out of the box. Each randomized \\Product{Dragoneye expansion pack} contains 8 randomly selected, prepainted, fully assembled, collectible miniatures with double-sided statistic cards for use with D&D roleplaying game or for fast-paced head-to-head combat. Three separate \\Product{Dragoneye miniatures packs} are pictured at left. Each one contains a random selection of miniatures."
