  description: "At 4th level, a monk\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed\n  attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to\n  creatures with damage reduction (see Damage Reduction, page 291 of the\n  Dungeon Master\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s Guide). Ki strike improves with the character\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s monk\n  level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons\n  for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th\n  level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose\n  of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness\n  (see Smashing an Object, page 165).
