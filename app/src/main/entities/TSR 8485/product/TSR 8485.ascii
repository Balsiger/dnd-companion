  description: "Determined to drive a trade route through \\Place{Anauroch}, the \\Group{Zhentarim} have sent an army to enslave the fierce nomads of the \\Place{Great Desert}. Asa tribe after tribe fall to the intruders, only a single woman, \\NPC{Ruha}, sees the true danger---but what sheikh will heed the advice of an outcast witch? \\NPC{Ruha} finds help from an unexpected source. The \\Group{Harpers}, guardians of liberty throughout the \\Place{Realms}, have sent an agent to counter the \\Group{Zhentarim}. If she can help this stranger win the trust of the sheikhs, perhaps he can overcome the tribes\' ancestral rivalries and drive the invaders from the desert. \\Product{The Parched Sea} is the first in an open-ended series focusing on the \\Group{Harpers}, the secret organization for Good in the Product{Forgotten Realms} fantasy world."
