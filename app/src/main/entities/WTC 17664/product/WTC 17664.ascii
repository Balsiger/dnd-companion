  description: "Great stories tell of mighty heroes finding fame and fortune in the head of combat. Whether fighting with steel, spells, savagery, or stealth, their exceptional prowess enables them to emerge victorious from even the most harrowing conflicts. This supplement for the D&D game provides everything you need to mold any character from any class into a force to be reckoned with in combat. Along with new character classes, prestige classes, feats, spells, and magic items, \\Product{Complete Warrior} also provides guidelines for running a martially focused campaign. To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}, the \\Product{Dungeon Master\'s Guide}, and the \\Product{Monster Manual}. A player needs only the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}."
