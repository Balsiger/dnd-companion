  description: "When Wanderlust overcomes young \\NPC{Trapspringer Fargo}, his insatiable drive for adventure propels him along a route that only a \\Monster{kender} could map. With curiosity as his only guide, he sets out across Place{Ansalon} and unknowingly crosses paths with a pair of corrupt Monster{gully dwarves} and a misplaced \\Monster{evil fiend} (Oops!). The result is not only the inevitable madness and mayhem, but also a chance for the diminutive \\NPC{Trapspringer} to save all of \\Place{Krynn} from a catastrophe of \\Place{Takhisian} proportions."
