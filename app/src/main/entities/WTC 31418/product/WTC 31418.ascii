  description: "For as long as anyone can remember, the mountain village of \\Place{Haven} has been under the protection of an ancient warlock known as the \\Place{Old Stargazer}. But after countless years spent deciphering the mysteries of the night sky, the old man is starting to slip. Now, a dark figure controls the forest with minions of \\Monster{kenku} marauders - crowlike men who menace the villagers with violence and mayhem.\n\nIf the \\NPC{Old Stargazer} cannot or will not protect them, the villagers will have find someone who can. \\NPC{Nergei}, an orphan raised by the warlock, is chosen to find help. Since \\NPC{Nergei} has nothing to offer potential mercenaries, his taks seems futile until he meets \\NPC{Sten}, a battle-weary adventurer whose sense of justice is stronger than his desire for gold.\n\nTogether they recruit an unlikely band of heroes to protect \\Place{Haven} from the ever-threatening incursions of the \\Monster{kenku} minions. When the group flushes the marauders into the light of day, the shadows cast by the crow-men are like none they have ever imagined."
