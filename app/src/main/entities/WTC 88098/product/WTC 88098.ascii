  description: "In the barren borderland between the kingdom of the \\Monster[elf]{elves} and the land of the \\Monster[dwarf]{dwarves}, outlaws seize an Monster[elf]{elven} princess. Sustained by faith in her husband and her god, she waits patiently for the rescue that is sure to come. But waiting is a dangerous game---one that can cause a princess and an outlaw to look beyond themselves. To dare to trust the enemy. In a place where suspicions run high and bloody battles are the order of the day, trust can be the most dangerous game of all."
