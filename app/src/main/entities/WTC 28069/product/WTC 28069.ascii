  description: "Few wizards know more about magic than the mighty \\NPC{Mordenkainen}, whose arcane achievements are without peer. He\'s the Archmage of Adventure ... and no stranger to unearthing hidden lore. Stand aside, \\NPC{Tenser}! Back to the books, \\NPC{Otiluke}! No one can match \\NPC{Mordenkainen}\'s collection of magic items. Still, he hardly seems the type to settle down and open a magic shop. And yet...\n\nWelcome to \\Product{Mordenkainen\'s Magnificient Emporium}, a wondrous collection of magic items --- each one with a story to tell. This tome provides Dungeon Masters with an assortment of treasures to tempt adventurers, and it supplies players with an arsenal to take on the most dangerous monsters. This book adds stories and adventure possibilities to the treasures presented within, setting these items apart from run-of-the-mill adventuring gear. Hold on to your magic hats --- everything must go!"
