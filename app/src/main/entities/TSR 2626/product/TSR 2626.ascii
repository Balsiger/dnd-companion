  description: "\\large{Four doors of mystery appear in the cage. They lead to four adventures, if a basher has the dark of them.} \\emph{\'These aren\'t doors in the traditional sense, cutter, but they\'re portals just the same. They appear for a short time every 500 years, popping up in different pars of \\Place{Sigil}. Each hides a mystery that\'s waiting to be solved, and together they just might hold the key to a secret of the \\Place{multiverse}. All a body\'s got to do is tumble to the right keys, open the doors, and face the Unknown.\' \\right{--- \\NPC{Estavan}, merchant lord}} \\Product{Doors to the Unknown} is a collection of four \\Product{Planescape} adventures that can be played separately or as a mini-campaign. When four doors appear in the \\Place{Cage}, the barmies crawl out of the shadows, and the heroes get drawn into events that could have consequences for the entire \\Place{multiverse}. Each doors leads to a different plane and a different deadly challenge for the player characters. Together they offer a way to stop an ancient menace before it strikes again. The \\Product{Planescape Campaign Setting} boxed set is required to run these adventures. The \\Product{Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix I} and \\Product{II} and \\Product{Uncaged: Faces of Sigil} are recommended to enhance play."
