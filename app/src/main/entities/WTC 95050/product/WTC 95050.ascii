  description: "Monsters and heroes face off on the miniatures battlefield! True to the head-to-head nature of the \\Product{D&D Miniatures Game}, the latest expansion set highlights miniatures against the backdrop of war. Per previous releases, the figures in the set are selected from key D&D roleplaying game titles such as \\Product{Monster Manual}, \\Product{Monster Manual III}, \\Product{Miniatures Handbook}, and the \\Product{Eberron} and \\Product{Forgotten Realms campaign} settings. The set also includes an elite group of figures that come with a second, epic-level stat card, allowing players to assemble higher-value armies with which to do battle."
