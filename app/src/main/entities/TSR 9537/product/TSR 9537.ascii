  description: "\\large{A knife flashes in the darkness. You never see the face of your attacker. The adventure begins.} \\emph{Their spirits trapped by a cursed magical weapon, the heroes find themselves imprisoned in the surreal domain of \\Place{Aggarath}. Here, they must explore the mind of \\NPC{Chardath Spulzeer}, the insane lord of the realm. Somewhere in his shattered dreams and tormented memories lie secrets that may enable the adventurers to escape.} \\Product{The Forgotten Terror} is a new adventure for the \\Product{Ravenloft} campaign setting. It can be played as a stand-alone scenario or as a sequel to the events depicted in the \\Product{Forgotten Realms} adventure \\Product{Castle Spulzeer}. The unique nature of this domain and scenario makes \\Product{The Forgotten Terror} easy for the Dungeon Master to run without forcing players through a linear plot. Alternate endings allow the DM to link this adventure to \\Place{Ravenloft}, the \\Place{Realms}, or any other campaign world."
