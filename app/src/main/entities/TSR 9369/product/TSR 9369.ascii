  description: "\\Place{Dragonspear Castle}. All who live within several hundred miles heard the name and know its import. Once home to the proud and brave, it stands now a ruin, cloaked behind a history of murder and diabolic plots. Few go there, for the only reward to be found is death. Rumors abound that \\Place{Dragonspear} holds a portal to the sinister planes, but until now those have been unfounded. Following a great battle against \\Monster{ords} and \\Place{trolls} from the \\Place{High Moor} who had taken possession of the castle, a temple to ward against further evil was established. However, by the \\Event{Time of Troubles}, that temple and its clergy had disappeared. Now, a horde of \\Monster{fiends} and monsters has amassed at \\Place{Dragonspear Castle}, and is terrorizing the surrounding countryside. The portal is active, that is for certain. The army of \\Place{Daggerford} needs reinforcements! Is your party made of the stuff of heroes? \\Product{Hordes of Dragonspear} can be played using either the \\Product{Battlesystem} miniatures rules, or the quick combat resolution system found in DMGR2, \\Place{The Castle Guide}. Alternatively, a few simple changes render the entire module playable without any special rules."
