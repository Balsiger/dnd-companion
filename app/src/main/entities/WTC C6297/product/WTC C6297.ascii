  description: "Nestled on the coast of the \\Place{Azure Sea} is \\Place{Saltmarsh}, a sleepy fishing village that sits on the precipice of destruction. Smugglers guide their shipts to hidden coves, willing to slit the throat of anyone fool enough to cross their path. Cruel sahuagin gather beneath the waves, plotting to sweep away coastal cities. Drowned sailors stir to unnatural life, animated by dark magic and sent forht in search of revenge. The cult of a forbidden god extends its reach outward from a decaying port, hungry for fresh victims and willing recruits. While \\Place{Saltmarsh} slumbers, the evils that seek to plunder it grow stronger. Heroes must arise to keep the sea lanes safe for all.\\par This supplement introduces the port town of \\Place{Saltmarsh}, the perfect starting point for a nautical campaign. Seven sea-based adventures, including the class \\Product{The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh} and its sequels, take characters from 1st to 12th level. Also inside are rules and DM advice for ships and sea travel, as well as deck plans for various vessels. An appendix provides rules for the new and classic monsters in the adventure.\\par Hoist your sails, pull up anchor, and set a course for adventure!"
