Whether you choose to explore the magic of the present age or delve into the truly ancient arts is up to you. This book exposes the magic and eldritch wonders of \\Place{Eberron}. In addition to presenting new arcane and divine spells, feats, prestige classes, and magic items, \\Product{Magic of Eberron} offers new options and infusions for \\Class{artificiers}, explorer dragon totem magic and the twisted\nexperiments of the \\Monster{daelkyr}, sheds light on the process of elemental\nbinding, and touches on other types of magic present in the world. Product{Magic of Eberron} explores the variety of magic available in the Place{Eberron} world. It introduces a wealth of new arcane and divine spells, and artificer infusions.
