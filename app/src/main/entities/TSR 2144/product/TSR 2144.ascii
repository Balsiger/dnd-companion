  description: "There is no little enemy. \\right{---\\emph{French proverb}} A paranoid warlord, a bitter \\Monster{drow} priestess, a power-mad archmage, a sly \\Monster{dwarven} assassin---not all the characters in the AD&D game went the way of heroes. Villains---beings dedicated to committing evil---are the most dangerous foes of all foes, and thus the most useful of all tools that a Dungeon Master has to create a memorable campaign. This book presents the most complete guidelines ever offered on creating villains for role-playing games. Miss this advice at your own peril!"
