  description: "\\Monster{Wolves} prowls the graveyard of the sleepy \\Place{Kingsholm}, and death lurks behind shadowed tombstones. Something has disturbed the sleepers in the mausoleum, and brave adventurers are needed to explore the catacombs beneath the graves and discover what evil stirs in the darkling depths. \\Product{Barrow of the Forgotten King} is a D&D adventure designed for 2nd-level characters. It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or as the first adventure in a three-part series. Each encounter contains special tactical information for the Dungeon Master and expanded map features for ease of play. The mighty statue of a forgotten king stands atop a lonely hill overlooking the town of \\Place{Kingsholm}. No one remembers the ancient sovereign or his dynasty, but locals shun the graveyard on the hillside near the statue. Sinister shapes lurk among the tombstones, and evil stirs in the catacombs below."
