  description: "Towering aloof and secure, the isolated fortress offers humankind a place to\n  survive and flourish in the barren realm of \\Place{Icereach}. Even the\n  \\Monster{elven} Messenger \\NPC{Kerrick Fallabrine} has made a home there,\n  living among the \\Monster{humans} and teaching them a multitude of\n  skills. But the \\Monster{ogre} enemies are always near, and they have\n  developed a powerful weapon, a destructive magic encased within a sphere of\n  solid gold. Its existence forces the \\Monster{humans} to confront the threat\n  of extinction that lurks outside their walls.\n\n  In the second book of this epic trilogy that began with \\Product{The\n  Messenger}, Douglas Niles carries the reader into the heart of an unknown\n  realm, where the world beneath the \\Place{Icewall} trembles with threats of\n  war, slavery, and greed."
