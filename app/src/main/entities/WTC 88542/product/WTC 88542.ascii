  description: "Towering aloof and secure, the isolated fortress offers humankind a place to survive and flourish in the barren realm of \\Place{Icereach}. Even the \\Monster{elven} Messenger \\NPC{Kerrick Fallabrine} has made a home there,\nliving among the \\Monster{humans} and teaching them a multitude of\nskills. But the \\Monster{ogre} enemies are always near, and they have developed a powerful weapon, a destructive magic encased within a sphere of solid gold. Its existence forces the \\Monster{humans} to confront the threat of extinction that lurks outside their walls. In the second book of this epic trilogy that began with \\Product{The Messenger}, Douglas Niles carries the reader into the heart of an unknown realm, where the world beneath the \\Place{Icewall} trembles with threats of war, slavery, and greed."
