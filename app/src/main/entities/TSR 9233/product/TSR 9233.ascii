  description: "North of \\Place{Waterdeep}, the land is cold, vast, and forbidding. The\n                    \\Place{Trackless Sea} stretches northward for what seems like forever,\n                    interrupted only by the occasional island and, eventually, the ice. On land,\n                    towns and villages flourish right up to the \\Place{Spine of the World}\n                    Mountains. It takes a special kind of person to live up here; a determined\n                    person used to hardship, a survivor. A person with a great love for life and\n                    a great respect for the forces---both natural and unnatural---that can end\n                    it.\n                    The \\Place{Savage Frontier} is now fully detailed for your roleplaying\n                    campaign. The cultures, personalities, economies, cities, towns, and\n                    wilderness are described for an AD&D campaign of any size or level. From the\n                    barbarian tribes of the far north to the \\Place{Luskan} pirates of the\n                    \\Place{Trackless Sea}, The \\Place{Savage Frontier} is an exciting land where\n                    adventure can be found anywhere. And, of course, it\'s all part of the\n                    best-selling \\Place{Forgotten Realms} Campaign Set, home of many other AD&D\n                    modules, source-books, and even novels!"
