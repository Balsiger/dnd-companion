  description: "In the embattled kingdom of \\Place{Qualinesti}, \\Group{Dark Knights} harass the common folk, and the once-proud \\Group{Elven Senate} moves at the will of the \\Monster{green dragon} \\NPC{Beryl}. Even the \\Monster{elf} king walks a tightrope betweena serving the needs of his people and keeping the\n\\Monster{dragon}\'s knights peaceful.\n\nOut of these mired politics a mysterious heroine arises, a \\Group{Kagonesti} woman of the forest glades and rocky eastern reaches. She and her loyal band of resistance fighters swiftly become the terror of the \\Group{Dark Knights}. Known to friend and foe as \\NPC{The Lioness}, she is the champion of the people who have been bled by the \\Monster{dragon}\'s taxes and ground under the steel-shod boots of the hostile knights. She is \\NPC{Kerianseray}, the king\'s own outlaw, his secret lover, and his secret weapon."
