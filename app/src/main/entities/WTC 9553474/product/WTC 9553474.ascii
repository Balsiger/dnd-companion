  description: "Rogue \\Monster{dragons} become heroes when a millennia-old curse is revealed. But knowing the cause of a disease and curing it are two very different things. And when most of the victims of the curse would rather not be cured of it at all, it gets a whole lot harder. Far up in the frozen wastelands of the bitter north, a ruined citadel holds the key to the Rage, and \\Monster{dragons} alive and undead, sane and mad, good and evil, converge there to decide the fate of their mighty race. For a \\Monster{half-golem} dragonslayer ending the curse has become less a mission of duty than of love, and that only makes it more vital that he succeed. It\'s been a difficult year for \\NPC{Dorn} and the allies but before it\'s over more blood will be spilled. The Year of Rogue Dragons draws to a close. \\Product{The Ruin} is the third title in a trilogy exploring the ancient secrets of \\Monster{dragon} society in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} world. Author Richard Lee Byers has written the entire trilogy, and the cover art for the trilogy and the associated anthology have been rendered by award-winning fantasy artist Matt Stawicki."
