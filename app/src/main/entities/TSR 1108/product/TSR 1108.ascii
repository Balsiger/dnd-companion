  description: "\\large{Terror in the \\Place{Land of Mists}} In the year 351 of the \\Place{Barovian} calendar, \\NPC{Strahd von Zarovich} made a pact with \\God{Death}---a pact that sealed his fate and created a land of nightmares known as \\Place{Ravenloft}. Other lords of darkness have embraced the \\Place{Demiplane of Dread} as their own, and woe to heroes who wander there. Creatures of the night prey freely upon the living in this land, and day is but a prelude to another night of horror. This new edition of the \\Product{Ravenloft} game combines the original \\Product{Realm of Terror} boxed set with elements from \\Product{Forbidden Lore} and updated rules from other accessories. Domains destroyed in the famous \\Event{Grand Conjunction} have been deleted, new domains added, and key personalities detailed. This boxed set includes: \\list {\\bold{Realm of Terror}---a 160-page book of rules concerning the reshaping of character classes; fear, horror, madness, and power checks; curses; spells and magical items, both new and old; psionics; techniques of terror; and more.} {\\bold{Domains and Denizens}---a 128-page book describing the dark lands of the \\Place{Core}, the \\Place{islands of terror}, and many nefarious personages.} {Two maps depicting the reshaped \\Place{Core} domains and the \\Place{islands of terror}.} {A post featuring a painting by artist Robh Ruppel.} {A tarokka deck of beautifully illustrated cards for role-playing fortunetelling.} {A DM screen specifically designed to be used with a Product{Ravenloft} campaign.}"
