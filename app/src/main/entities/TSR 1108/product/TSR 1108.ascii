  description: "\\large{Terror in the \\Place{Land of Mists}}\n                    In the year 351 of the \\Place{Barovian} calendar, \\NPC{Strahd von Zarovich}\n                    made a pact with \\God{Death}---a pact that sealed his fate and created a land\n                    of nightmares known as \\Place{Ravenloft}. Other lords of darkness have\n                    embraced the \\Place{Demiplane of Dread} as their own, and woe to heroes who\n                    wander there. Creatures of the night prey freely upon the living in this\n                    land, and day is but a prelude to another night of horror.\n                    This new edition of the \\Product{Ravenloft} game combines the original\n                    \\Product{Realm of Terror} boxed set with elements from \\Product{Forbidden\n                    Lore} and updated rules from other accessories. Domains destroyed in the\n                    famous \\Event{Grand Conjunction} have been deleted, new domains added, and\n                    key personalities detailed. This boxed set includes:\n                    \\list\n                    {\\bold{Realm of Terror}---a 160-page book of rules concerning the\n                    reshaping of character classes; fear, horror, madness, and power\n                    checks; curses; spells and magical items, both new and old; psionics;\n                    techniques of terror; and more.}\n                    {\\bold{Domains and Denizens}---a 128-page book describing the dark\n                    lands of the \\Place{Core}, the \\Place{islands of terror}, and many\n                    nefarious personages.}\n                    {Two maps depicting the reshaped \\Place{Core} domains and the\n                    \\Place{islands of terror}.}\n                    {A post featuring a painting by artist Robh Ruppel.}\n                    {A tarokka deck of beautifully illustrated cards for role-playing\n                    fortunetelling.}\n                    {A DM screen specifically designed to be used with a\n                    \\Product{Ravenloft} campaign.}"
