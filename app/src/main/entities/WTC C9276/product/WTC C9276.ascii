  description: "Once every eight years, the fantastic \\Group{Witchlight Carnival} touches down on your world, bringing joy to one settlement after the next. Its owners, \\NPC{Mister Witch} and \\NPC{Mister Light}, know how to put on a good show. But there’s more to this magical extravaganza than meets the eye!\n\nThe carnival is a gateway to a fantastic \\Place{Feywild} domain unlike anything found on the \\Place{Material Plane}. Time has not been kind to this realm, however, and dark days lie ahead unless someone can thwart the dastardly schemes of the \\Group{Hourglass Coven}.\n\n\\Product{The Wild Beyond the Witchlight} takes adventurers from the \\Place{Witchlight Carnival} to \\Place{Prismeer}, a \\PlaceFeywild} domain of delight, and is designed for characters of levels 1–8. This book comes with a poster map that shows the carnival on one side and \\Place{Prismeer} on the other.\n\n\\list{Explore the \\Place{Plane of Faerie} in the first official D&D adventure set primarily in the \\Place{Feywild}.}{The adventure begins on a campaign world of the DM’s choice. The \\Group{Witchlight Carnival}, which serves as the means by which the characters enter the \\Place{Feywild}, can be dropped easily into any campaign setting.}{Adds two new character backgrounds: the Feylost (for characters who grew up in the Feywild) and the Witchlight Hand (for characters who work at the Witchlight Carnival).}{Introduces two races — play as a \\Monster{fairy} or as a \\Place{harengon}, a race of humanoid rabbits.}{All encounters in the adventure include a non-combat option, allowing players to think and roleplay their way through the adventure if they wish.}{Classic 1980s Dungeons & Dragons characters return, including \\NPC{Warduke}, \\NPC{Strongheart}, and \\NPC{Kelek}.\n\n\\bold{On the Cover}\n\n\\Group{The Witchlight Carnival} has come to town! On the back cover, a displacer beast finds 8-year-old Tyler Jacobson and leads him back to the carnival, where he belongs."
