  description: "\\Place{Mithral Hall} is under siege, \\Place{Nesm\\grave{e}} is overrun, and\n                    even powerful \\Place{Silverymoon} braces for war. Through it all,\n                    \\NPC{Drizzt} has fought alone, but as the conflict draws to a bloody\n                    conclusion, the \\NPC{Hunter} will have to find allies both new and old---or\n                    die along with the rest of the civilized \\Place{North}.\n                    The conclusion of the \\emph{New York Time} best-selling trilogy decides the\n                    fate of \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden}.\n                    This title is the third and final book in the latest trilogy from\n                    R.A. Salvatore, which once again features his popular \\Monster{dark elf}\n                    character \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden}. The hardcover release of this title had the\n                    highest debut ever on The New York Times best seller list for a Salvatore\n                    title with Wizards of the Coast at #4. The title stayed in the top twenty for\n                    five weeks. Both of the previous titles in the series were also New York\n                    Times best sellers upon hardcover release, and the first title, \\Product{The\n                    Thousand Orcs}, hit the list upon mass-market release as well."
