  description: "What started out as just an experiment on Monte\'s home campaigns has become the hottest set of options designed to enhance the excitement of your favorite roleplaying game --- so popular it spawned a sequel! Now, for the first time, you can get these two books in one print volume as \\Product{The Collected Book of Experimental Might}.\n\nThis collection of Monte\'s own house rules includes...\n\n\\list\n{A spell progression system redefinging spell levels from 1 to 20}\n{New rules for fighting domains: areas of specialization like Two-Weapon Fighting, Mounted Combat, and Fighting Dirty, as well as techniques based on agility, speed, strength, and intellect --- the 15 domains provide new abilities to fighter types willing to devote themselves to a focused path}\n{A retooling of the feat system, with three new concepts --- double feats, oblation feats, and ueberfeats --- and dozens of new choices}\n{special benefits for choosing a feat as a fighter bonus feat, reinstating the fighter class as the king of feats}\n{New rules for healing and curative magic}\n{Powerful magical disciplines that allow wizards, clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers to have magic always active}\n{The runeblade, a base class that combines magic and martial skill without the need for spells}\n{Additional skills, feats, and combat rules}\n{Dozens of spells and magic items}\n\nInherent within these two books is the idea that characters should be able to keep on adventuring longer than the rules currently allow and that every class can use some extra options for greater playability.\n\n\\bold{Start your own experiment now!}\n\nThis book combines \\Product{The Book of Experimental Might} and \\Product{The Book of Experimental Might II: Bloody, Bold, and Resolute}.\n"
