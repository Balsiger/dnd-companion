  description: "\'Far be it from me to impugn the mettle of adventurers such as yourself, but\n                    daring the depths of \\Place{Undermountain} merely for fortune\'s sake is more\n                    absurd than kicking a sleeping \\Monster[Dragon]{dragon} in the nose for\n                    sport. Even so, you\'ve returned for another trip to the\n                    \\Place[Undermountain]{Underhalls}, so be prepared. You stand to enter the\n                    \\Place{Lost Level} this time---gird yourselves for diplomacy as well as\n                    destruction. You\'ll find the last stronghold of an extinct\n                    \\Monster[Dwarf]{dwarven} clan---do be good enough to extend the greetings of\n                    the \\NPC[Khelben \'Blackstaff\' Arunsun]{Blackstaff} to \\NPC{Bandaerl}. There\'s\n                    also a dark \\Monster[Vampire]{vampiress} who enjoys a good hunt, and be sure\n                    to mind the \\Monster[Beholder]{beholders}---they\'re trained to keep you from\n                    escaping. Enjoy, and don\'t say \\NPC[Khelben \'Blackstaff\' Arunsun]{Khelben}\n                    didn\'t warn thee.\n                    This \\Product[TSR 9519]{Dungeon Crawl} adventure includes 32 pages of combat\n                    and role-playing hearkening back to classic AD&D dungeon of old. This is a\n                    stand-alone module and does not require additional support materials. It can\n                    easily be inserted into a campaign on any world, but best fits an\n                    \\Place{Undermountain} or \\Place{Waterdeep} campaign within the\n                    \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}."
