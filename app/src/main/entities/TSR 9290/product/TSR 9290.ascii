  description: "The \\Monster{Purple Dragon} is caged. But \\Place{Ra-Khati} isn\'t out of danger. The evil Raja \\NPC{Ambuchar Devayam} is holding the \\NPC{Dalai Lama} to his promise. If the player-characters don\'t deliver Princess \\NPC{Bhrokiti} and the \\NPC{Black Courser} to him---and even if they do---the \\NPC[Raja of Solon]{Raja}\'s foul army will once again march on the \\Place{Hidden Kingdom}. What is it that \\NPC[Ambuchar Devayam]{Devayam} really wants with \\Place{Ra-Khati}? Only your player-characters can discover the awful truth. When they do, their journey will take them to the farthest reaches of \\Place{Shou Lung}. Providing they can escape the diabolic assassin sent to stop them, they will find the lost city of \\Place{Kuo Meilan}. There, they must penetrate to the lost city\'s wicked heart and find the \\Item{Stone Sceptre of Shih}. Only armed with this artifact, and the secret connecting it to \\NPC{Ambuchar Devayam}, can they hope to save \\Place{Ra-Khati}---or themselves! \\Product[TSR 9290]{The Black Courser} is the second adventure in the \\Product{Empires Adventures Trilogy}, taking place in the new \\Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign world described in \\Product[TSR 1055]{The Horde} campaign set. The \\Product{Empires Adventures Trilogy} is also set amidst the turbulent events protrayed in the \\Product{Empires Novel Trilogy}. This adventure is designed for four to eight player characters of levels 6--9, and can be played as a separate, stand-alone module or as a follow-up to FRA1, \\Product[TSR 9281]{Storm Riders}. Look for the other \\Product[Empires Adventures Trilogy]{Empires Adventures}: \\Product[TSR 9281]{Storm Riders} (available now) and \\Product[TSR 9304]{Blood Charge} (coming soon!)."
