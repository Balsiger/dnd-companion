  description: "Deep beneath the mountain fortress of \\Place{Skullcap}, legend has it, are the remains of the dark \\Class{wizard} \\NPC{Fistandantilus} and the path to the gates of the \\Monster{dwarven} kingdom of \\Place{Thorbardin}. Buried\nsomewhere along that perilous path is the magical \\Item{helm of\n\\NPC{Grallen}}, son of \\NPC{King Duncan}, tragic hero of the \\Event{Dwarfgate War}. The finder of \\Item{\\NPC{Grallen}\'s helm}, it is prophesized, will be rewarded and honored by a united \\Place{Thorbardin} -- but he will also open the gates of the realm to fresh horror and chaos. In \\Product{The Gates of Thorbardin}, Dan Parkinson, author of Product{Starsong}, continues the history of the \\Monster{dwarves} of Place{Krynn} in the tradition of Nancy Varian Berberick\'s best-selling Place{Dragonlance} novel, \\Product{Stormblade}."
