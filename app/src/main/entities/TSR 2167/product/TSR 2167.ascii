  description: "\\large{Welcome To the AD&D CD-ROM Core Rules!} The AD&D \\Product{CD-ROM Core Rules} product is designed to increase your enjoyment of the AD&D game. It accomplishes much of the \'work\' of the game and allows you to enjoy creative play with a number of tools to assist you along the way. The product is divided into three major sections: \\emph{Player Character} aids in the creation and upkeep of player characters; \\emph{Book On Line} provides a quick, easy way to find and manipulate information about the game system; and the \\emph{DM Toolkit} offers utilities to assist in the creation of fun and interesting adventures. In addition to these three main sections, the \\emph{Village Tour} presents a short, animated AD&D adventure. \\Product{Core Rules} is based primarily on the game system as explained in the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook} and \\Product{Dungeon Master Guide}. This is supplemented by the \\Product{Monstrous Manual} tome, \\Product{Arms and Equipment Guide}, and \\Product{Tome of Magic}. Here you will find the core of the game system from which everything else derives."
