  description: "Deep below the surface lies an ancient \\Monster{beholder} city called\n                    \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax}. In times past, hundreds of \\Monster{beholders} called\n                    it home---until simmering rivalries within their society exploded into\n                    warfare. The few survivors fled, leaving the city deserted for hundreds of\n                    years. However, the story of \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax}\'s glory was passed down\n                    from one generation of \\Monster{beholders} to the next. Now, after countless\n                    years of self-imposed exile, the \\Monster{beholders} are back!\n                    After securing the city, the \\Monster{hive mother} of \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax}\n                    implemented a plan to wipe out all the beings living above it. Unfortunately\n                    for the \\Monster{beholders}, several facets of the \\Monster{hive mother}\'s\n                    plan have been revealed through the exploits of a party of adventurers. Now,\n                    this group of heroes must meet eye to eye with \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax}\'s newest\n                    occupants in an effort to stop the \\Monster{hive mother}\'s pernicious plan!\n                    \\Product{Eye to Eye} is the last of three adventures featuring the\n                    nightmarish \\Monster{beholder}.
