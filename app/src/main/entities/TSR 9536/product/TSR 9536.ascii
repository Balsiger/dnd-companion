  description: "Deep below the surface lies an ancient \\Monster{beholder} city called \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax}. In times past, hundreds of \\Monster{beholders} called it home---until simmering rivalries within their society exploded into warfare. The few survivors fled, leaving the city deserted for hundreds of years. However, the story of \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax}\'s glory was passed down from one generation of \\Monster{beholders} to the next. Now, after countless years of self-imposed exile, the \\Monster{beholders} are back! After securing the city, the \\Monster{hive mother} of \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax} implemented a plan to wipe out all the beings living above it. Unfortunately for the \\Monster{beholders}, several facets of the \\Monster{hive mother}\'s plan have been revealed through the exploits of a party of adventurers. Now, this group of heroes must meet eye to eye with \\Place{Ilth K\'hinax}\'s newest occupants in an effort to stop the \\Monster{hive mother}\'s pernicious plan! \\Product{Eye to Eye} is the last of three adventures featuring the nightmarish \\Monster{beholder}. It can be played as an individual mission or as part of the series that began with \\Product{Eye of Pain} and continued in \\Product{Eye of Doom}. For four to six characters of levels 8--12"
