  description: "The greatest order of chivalry in the history of \\Place{Krynn}. After a \\Class{knight} has achieved the \\Group{Order of the Crown}, he must then begin his training in the virtues of courage and heroism in order to achieve the \\Group{Order of the Sword}.\n\nThis is the second tale of \\NPC{Sir Pirvan the Wayward}, whose reluctant and\ninauspicious beginnings bore few clues to his potential as a \\Group{Knight of the Sword} or as a \\Group{Knight of the Crown}, nor as a mentor for another similarly dubious prospect for \\Place{Krynn}\'s greatest order of chivalry. Roland J. Green is the author of the Starcruiser Shenandoah and Wandor series and numerous Conan novels, and is coauthor (with Jerry Pournelle) of the Jannisaries series. Product{The Warriors} series details the exploits of the heroes and villains of the \\Product{War of the Lance}."
