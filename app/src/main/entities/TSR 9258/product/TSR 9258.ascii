  description: "The peninsula of \\Place{Wa} is no place to visit. The land is poor, the people wary and suspicious. Yet this quiet backwater has been the site of strange disturbances---mysterious disappearances and omens of dire events to come. Why do the animals of \\Place{Wa} mysteriously disappear, only to return a short while later? Who are the \\Group{Blue Kumi} bandits, and why are they so active? Who do the black geese fly into the \\Place{Jusofu Mountains}? And what fell creature lurks along the southern coast of \\Place{Wa}? Or does the stench of corruption emanate from the \\Group{Celestial Bureaucracy} itself? Could the danger, unchecked, grow great enough to doom all living creatures in \\Place{Kara-Tur}? Which clues will lead to the truth, and which are merely traps for the unwary... \\Product[TSR 9258]{Test of the Samurai} will take the players across the \\Place{Wa} peninsula and to the unknown land of \\Place{Qui}. They will encounter such legendary beasts as the \\Monster[Feng Huan]{feng huan} (\\Monster[Phoenix]{phoenix}) and the \\Monster[Chi\'-Lin]{chi\'-lin} (\\Monster[Unicorn]{unicorn}) as they attempt to discover the secrets of \\Place{Wa}. \\Product[TSR 9258]{Test of the Samurai} is a scenario for the \\Product[TSR 2018]{Oriental Adventures} supplement to the AD&D game. It is set in \\Place{Kara-Tur}, the oriental world in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}. Although \\Product[TSR 9258]{Test of the Samurai} follows the events of module OA6, \\Product[TSR 9257]{Ronin Challenge}, it is an independent adventure for five to eight characters of Levels 6--9."
