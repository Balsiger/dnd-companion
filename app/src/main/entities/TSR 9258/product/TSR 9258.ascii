  description: "The peninsula of \\Place{Wa} is no place to visit. The land is poor, the\n                    people wary and suspicious. Yet this quiet backwater has been the site of\n                    strange disturbances---mysterious disappearances and omens of dire events to\n                    come. Why do the animals of \\Place{Wa} mysteriously disappear, only to return\n                    a short while later? Who are the \\Group{Blue Kumi} bandits, and why are they\n                    so active? Who do the black geese fly into the \\Place{Jusofu Mountains}? And\n                    what fell creature lurks along the southern coast of \\Place{Wa}?\n                    Or does the stench of corruption emanate from the \\Group{Celestial\n                    Bureaucracy} itself? Could the danger, unchecked, grow great enough to doom\n                    all living creatures in \\Place{Kara-Tur}? Which clues will lead to the truth,\n                    and which are merely traps for the unwary...\n                    \\Product[TSR 9258]{Test of the Samurai} will take the players across the\n                    \\Place{Wa} peninsula and to the unknown land of \\Place{Qui}. They will\n                    encounter such legendary beasts as the \\Monster[Feng Huan]{feng huan}\n                    (\\Monster[Phoenix]{phoenix}) and the \\Monster[Chi\'-Lin]{chi\'-lin}\n                    (\\Monster[Unicorn]{unicorn}) as they attempt to discover the secrets of\n                    \\Place{Wa}.\n                    \\Product[TSR 9258]{Test of the Samurai} is a scenario for the \\Product[TSR\n                    2018]{Oriental Adventures} supplement to the AD&D game. It is set in\n                    \\Place{Kara-Tur}, the oriental world in the \\Place{Forgotten\n                    Realms}. Although \\Product[TSR 9258]{Test of the Samurai} follows the events\n                    of module OA6, \\Product[TSR 9257]{Ronin Challenge}, it is an independent\n                    adventure for five to eight characters of Levels 6--9."
