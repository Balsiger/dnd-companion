  description: "A band of war-weary soldiers have uncovered a plot that may tear the very fabric of reality forever. To save their own lives and to prevent a long-banished race of monsters from unleashing an army of horrors upon the waking world, they must reach the very hear of \\Place{Dal Quor}. To stop the cataclysm in time, they must fight their way to ... large{The Gates of Night}.\n\nAfter their near-fatal adventure in Xen\'drik, \\NPC{Daine} and his companions are left with one choice: they must enter the plane of \\Place{Dal Quor} to stop the Dreaming Dark before the forces of darkness can open the \\Item{Gates of Night} and unlease an army of horrors upon the waking world. Their adventure takes them throughout the \\Place{outer planes}, into realms beyond imagining. As \\NPC{Daine} struggles to retain his sanity, \\NPC{Lei} unravels more of her past and discovers that her heritage is far darker -- and stranger -- then she\'d ever imagined."
