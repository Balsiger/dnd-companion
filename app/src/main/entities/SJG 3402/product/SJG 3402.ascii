  description: "What can a \\emph{Munchkin} GM do?\n\n  Whatever he wants. Player annoys you? Kill him. Or change his sex. Or turn\n  him into a Canada goose. Go all the way and turn him into a dead sex-changed\n  Canada goose. No one can stop you. When you\'re the GM, the rules are only\n  suggestions --- and mild ones at that.\n\n  So the \\Product{Munchkin Master\'s Guide} is 48 pages of evil suggestions:\n  magic items, powerful NPC classes, terrifying tables, and a loaded 100-sided\n  die\'s worth of dirty tricks.\n\n  Remember --- It\'s \\emph{good} to be the GM."
