  description: "For decades the ghastly \\Group{Night Parade} has haunted the sleep of many\n                    in the \\Place{Realms}, but most thought it was nothing more than figments\n                    born of troubled minds. They were wrong.\n                    \\NPC{Myrmeen Lhal}, the seductive rules of \\Place{Arabel}, becomes embroiled\n                    in a war against the \\Group{Night Parade}, a war in which the \\Group{Harpers}\n                    are her only allies. She must triumph against these creatures who live in\n                    fear and mistery---for the monstrous band\'s leaders have the daughter she\n                    thought dead for fourteen years past.\n                    \\Product{The Night Parade} is the fourth in an open-ended series of novels\n                    focusing on the \\Group{Harpers}, the secret organization for Good in the\n                    \\Place{Forgotten Realms} fantasy world."
