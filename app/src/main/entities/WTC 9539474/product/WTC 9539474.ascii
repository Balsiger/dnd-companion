  description: "Shadows in the forest deepen as an oracle among the \\Place{Yuirwood}\'s \\Monster{half-elf} inhabitants foretells the reemergence of the \\NPC{Duskwalker}, an ancient and corrupt star \\Monster{elf} \\Class{wizard}. Missing travelers and lost goods all point to a circle of standing stones within the forest. Perhaps, like its counterparts elsewhere in the \\Place{Yuirwood}, this stone henge allows for travel to another place---but where? And what growing darkness awaits those bold enough to find out? \\Product{The Twilight Tomb} is a stand-alone DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed to take four 3rd-level characters from the sun-dappled paths of the \\Place{Yuirwood} into a realm created by a bygone betrayal. Although the adventure is set in the \\Place{Aglarond} region of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}, it can easily be placed in any D&D campaign."
