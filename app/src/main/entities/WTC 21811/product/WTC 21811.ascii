Below them, in the cold valleys, an evil force broods: the\n                    magic of \\Item{Crenshinibon}, the \\Item{crystal shard}.\n                    Now \\Monster{dwarf}, barbarian, and \\Monster[drow]{drow elf} join to battle\n                    this evil. Tempered in the furnace of struggle, they form an unbreakable\n                    friendship.\n                    A legend is born.\n                    For the first time in one volume, here is New York Times bestselling author\n                    R.A. Salvatore\'s adventure that introduced \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden}, the heroic\n                    \\Monster[drow]{dark elf}, one of the most beloved characters in fantasy\n                    literature."
