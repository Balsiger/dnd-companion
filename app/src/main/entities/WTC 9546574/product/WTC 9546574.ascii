  description: "As I became a creature of the empty tunnels, survival became easier and more difficult all at once. I gained in the physical skills and experience necessary to live on. I could defeat almost anything that wandered into my chosen domain. It did not take me long, however, to discover one nemesis that I could neither defeat nor flee. It followed me wherever I went---indeed, the farther I ran, the more it closed in around me. My enemy was solitude, the interminable, incessant silence of hushed corridors. -- \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden} This release of the classic R.A. Salvatore novel continues the tale of the origins of Salvatore\'s signature \\Monster{dark elf} character \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden}."
