  description: "\\large{In the \\Place{Outer Planes}, a holy sword can be a \\Monster{fiend}\'s best friend, especially when the owner wants it back...} \\emph{Sneaking into the second layer of foul \\Place{Baator} ain\'t easy, but with a little help from the right high-up men, it can be done. \'Course, exactly who the right high-up men \\emph{are} can give a basher pause, so it\'s often best not to ask. But there\'s a sword to be found, and bloods needed to find it. Truth is, those who don\'t end up lost are sure to find out that no good deed goes unpunished!} \\Product{Fires of Dis} is a \\Product{Planescape} adventure for four to six characters of 5th to 9th levels. From \\Place{Sigil}, the \\Place{City of Doors}, the heroes plunge head-first into a dangerous journey across the \\Place{Outer Planes}. Their quest for a stolen sword leads them to the hostile gate-town of \\Place{Ribcage}, the treacherous plane of \\Place{Baator}, and the disciplined burg of \\Place{Fortitude}---a gate-town teetering between two planes, just waiting for something to tip the scales. Your player characters need wits as keen as their steel to brave the fires of Dis---and survive!"
