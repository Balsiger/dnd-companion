  description: "\\NPC{Sarya Dlardrageth} has gone to ground in the ruins of \\Place{Myth Drannor}, seething with hatred for the \\Monster[elf]{elves} she thought would be easier to defeat. \\NPC{Malkizid} has been summoned from the \\Place{Outer Planes} to serve \\Group{House Dlardrageth}, but this servant won\'t rest until he\'s become the master. \\Place{Myth Drannor} is a symbol of the \\Monster[elf]{elves}\' greatest failure, but can it one day rise again as their greatest victory? The New York Times best-selling author Richard Baker continues an epic trilogy that will redefine the \\Monster[elf]{elves} of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}}n. \\Product{Farthest Reach} is the second novel in a trilogy chronicling the tempestuous return of an isolated society of \\Monster{elves} to the mainland of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} world. The events in this trilogy will have a far-reaching impact across the entire setting."
