  description: "Is your \\Place{Forgotten Realms} character an \\Monster[Elf]{elf}? A\n                    \\Monster[Dwarf]{dwarf}? Maybe a \\Monster[Gnome]{gnome}? Perhaps, yet that\n                    doesn\'t really say much, does it? One might just as easily say there\'s not\n                    difference between a \\Place[Calimshan]{Calishite} and a \\Place[Thay]{Tayan}\n                    because they\'re both \\Monster[Human]{humans}! No one is \\emph{just} a\n                    \\Monster[Demihuman]{demihuman} in the \\Place[Forgotten\n                    Realms]{Realms}---there are acrobats, barbarians, \\Monster[Giant]{giant}\n                    killers, manhunters, pestkillers, prospectors, and even tunnelrats, but\n                    they\'re all \\Monster[Demihuman]{demihumans} and they all walk the face of\n                    \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}.\n                    Within these pages are dozens of kits designed to help players in a\n                    \\Place{Forgotten Realms} \\Product[TSR 1085]{campaign} enrich their characters\n                    and make them truly native to the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}. Special\n                    benefits and disadvantages for each kit enhance the roleplaying experience\n                    while allowing characters to reflect their social roots and racial\n                    heritages. This companion to \\Product[TSR 9492]{Wizards and Rogues of the\n                    Realms} and \\Product[TSR 9509]{Warriors and Priests of the Realms} completes\n                    the series of kit-based sourcebooks for the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}\n                    \\Product[TSR 1085]{campaign}."
