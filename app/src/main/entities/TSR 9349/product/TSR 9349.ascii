  description: "Somewhere in the \\Place{True World}, to the north of the lands you know,\n                    lies the \\Place[Michaca]{City of Gold}: \\Place{Michaca}. It is a city of\n                    legend, of fable, and of wonder. The journey is hard, and the perils are\n                    many; you know, however, that the rewards will far outshine any treasure you\n                    have ever seen.\n                    This supplement for the \\Place{Maztica} Campaign Setting is a new type of\n                    product: a combination adventure and accessory. In this booklet you will find\n                    information on a new character race, the \\Monster{Azuposi}; on new character\n                    classes for rogues, including the clown (or \\emph{koyemshis}); on new priest\n                    classes, including the \'bent priest\'; and a new magic unique to\n                    \\Place{Maztica}, fetishism.\n                    The adventure itself leads your party from the known areas of the \\Place{True\n                    World} into the northlands, through the lands of the \\Monster[Desert\n                    Dwarf]{desert dwarves}, the \\Monster[Poscada Elf]{Poscada elves}, the\n                    \\Group{Dog People}, and others. Your characters will also confront spirits\n                    they\'ve never heard of: the spirits that have caused the downfall of\n                    \\Place{Michaca}, the \\Place[Michaca]{City of Gold}.\n                    And do not forget the words of a poet of another place, and another time:\n                    \'Nor all that tempts your wand\'ring eyes / And headless hearts, is lawful\n                    price; / Nor all, that glisters, gold.\'"
