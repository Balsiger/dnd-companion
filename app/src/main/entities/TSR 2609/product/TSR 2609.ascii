  description: "Welcome to the \\Place{Cage}! That\'s \\Place{Sigil}, \\Place{City of Doors}---realm of the \\NPC{Lady of Pain}, gateway to all planes and possibilities.

Now DMs and cutters alike can discover: \\list {little-known facts about \\Place{Sigil}\'s sites and personalities} {a guide to major portals} {maps of famous locales, fiendish and divine} {evocative illustrations by DiTerlizzi, Dameron, Ruppel and Berry} {an all-new, full-color, poster-sized map of the city, pinpointing places heretofore unseen} Which pubs cater to the clueless, and which\'re quick to put a sod in the dead-book? Where do folks gather to catch an \'Execution by Wyrm\'? For whom do the \\Item{Bells of Baphomet} toll? Exposing both the low life and glittering highlights, \\Product{In the Cage} is an essential guide for any blood who plans on exploring Sigil\'s streets---especially any blood who plans to leave under his own power."
