  description: "The legendary coastal city of \\Place{Carsall} existed two centuries\n                    ago---before it vanished beneath the waves, reputedly at the hands of an\n                    angry sea god. Stories of the city and tales of fabulous artifacts\n                    originating from \\Place{Carsall} still abound. Now, the clerics of a seaside\n                    town have proven that some unusual items are indeed from the legendary\n                    city---and two priests involved in the process, as well as a mysterious\n                    stranger, are missing.\n                    Are player characters willing to risk life and breath beneath the water to\n                    find the lost city? Does the city truly exist, or is the story simply a hoax\n                    put forth by crooked fishermen? Take the plunge---explore \\Product{The Murky\n                    Deep}!"
