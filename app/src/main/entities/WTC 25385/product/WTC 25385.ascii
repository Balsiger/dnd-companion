  description: "For generations, the \\Place{Tomb of Horrors} has held an inescapable allure. It draws adventurers to it like a beacon and the devours them utterly like some monstrous predator. Within its sepulchral, trap-ridden halls and chambers lay the secrets and treasures of the \\Monster{demilich} \\NPC{Acererak} and, some say, the \\Monster{demilich} himself. Product{Tomb of Horros} is a far-reaching Dungeons & Dragons adventure that takes characters from 10th level to 22nd level, with natural break periods between stages for other adventures. It includes background material, adventure hooks, new monsters and magic items, and a powerful campaign arc that pits heroes against a deadly dungeon complex and its echoes in the planes of the \\Place{Feywild} and the \\Place{Shadowfell}. This adventure also includes a double-sided map depicting key encounter sites."
