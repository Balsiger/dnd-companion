  description: "\\Product[TSR 9444]{Marco Volo: Departure} is the first volume of the \\Product[Marco Volo Trilogy]{Marco Volo} trilogy, designed for four to eight player characters of levels 6-8. This free-wheeling adventure begins with an intrigue-laden journey from \\Place{Waterdeep} to \\Place{Shadowdale}. The party is thrown into the company of one \\NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus Wands} (also known as \'\\NPC{Marco Volo}\'), a bothersome but likeable little rogue. In his guise of \\NPC[Marco Volo]{Marco}, he gains unintentional help from the party members, leading only to their own arrests. To remedy that predicament, the characters are strong-armed into carrying an important letter to Shadowdale, and taking along \\NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus} as their \'guide\'. Of course, things are nowhere near as simple as they seem. There\'s this little matter of the \\Item{Dragonking\'s Eye}, a powerful artifact from another plane. Naively, \\NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus} thought he could steal the thing and pin the theft on \\NPC{Volothamp Geddarm}, the roguish author of many popular books about cities in the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}. The notorious mage-assassin \\NPC{Felibarr Blacklance} has been hired to hunt the thief, and he is a man grimly determined to earn his fee. Then, there\'s the business about this letter that\'s on its way to \\Place{Shadowdale}. It is accompanied by a rare enchanted item that wizards and fortune hunters want to obtain at all costs. A series of adventures ensues that takes the adventurers from \\Place{Waterdeep} to the \\Place{Way Inn}, by which time they will doubtless suspect there is more to \\NPC{Marco Volo} than meets the eye. Amid the brawls and mistaken identities, the wild rides and glowering villains, the characters never have a chance to slow down or catch their collective breath. What results is a light-hearted, picaresque adventure in the manner of Dumas and Sabatini, and a good time is had by all! (Except the bad guys, of course. They\'re never happy with how things are turning out...)"
