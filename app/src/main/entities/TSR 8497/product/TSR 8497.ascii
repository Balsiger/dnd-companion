  description: "\\NPC{Cadderly} is charged with waging war between the combined forces of \\Place{Carradoon} and \\Place{Shilmista Forest} and the fiends of \\Place{Castle Trinity}, the stronghold of his nemesis. Instead he sets off with a small force of his own to conduct a smaller campaign, using his increasingly powerful priestly magic. Neither the journey nor the battle go as easily as planned, and \\NPC{Cadderly} must come to terms with both his friends\' expectations and with a past he\'d almost rather forget. \\Product{The Fallen Fortress} is the fourth in a new series of novels entitled \\Product{The Cleric Quintet}, set in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} fantasy world from TSR, Inc. Author R.A. Salvatore also wrote the \\Product{New York Times} best-selling novels \\Product{The Halfling\'s Gem} and Product{The Legacy}, his first hardcover novel."
