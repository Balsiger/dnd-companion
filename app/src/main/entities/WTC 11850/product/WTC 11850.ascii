  description: "\\large{Visit New Dimensions} The most powerful adventurers know that great rewards---and great perils---await them beyond the world they call home. From the depth of \\Place{Hell} to the heights of \\Place{Mount Celestia}, from the clockworld world of \\Place{Mechanus} to the swirling chaos of \\Place{Limbo}, these strange and terrifying dimensions provide new challenges to adventurers who travel there. \\Product{Manual of the Planes} is your guidebook on a tour of the \\Place{multiverse}. This supplement for the D&D game provides everything you need to know before you visit other planes of existence. Included are new prestige classes, spells, monsters, and magic items. Along with descriptions of dozens of new dimensions, \\Product{Manual of the Planes} includes rules for creating your own planes. To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}, the \\Product{Dungeon Master\'s Guide} and the \\Product{Monster Manual}. A player needs only the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}."
