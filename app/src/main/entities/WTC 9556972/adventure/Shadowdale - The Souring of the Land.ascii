    tactics: "The shadow spider lurks in the shadows of its lair until the characters attempt the perilous ascent or descent. It attacks the first creature to pass by its niche with its four claws. If successful in establishing a grapple, it attempts to carry the victim to its larder by using \\Spell{shadow walk}, paralyzes it there, and then returns to seize another victim. It only returns to its larder to begin eating if there are no more targets or if it is in danger of dying."
  }
  development: "The guards in area 2A come to investigate activity in this area if they make a successful opposed Listen check, with a –12 circumstance penalty, or if the alarm is triggered. They do not intervene if they spy the shadow spider in combat, but they do wait to see if it prevails or leaves any interlopers alive."
