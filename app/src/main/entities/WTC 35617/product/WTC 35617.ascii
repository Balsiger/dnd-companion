  description: "Image untamed oceans wracked by lightning, whirlwinds of seething flame and roaring thunder, and massive shards of flying earth and ice. Welcome to the \\Place{Elemental Chaos}, the raw plane from which the gods and the primordials fashioned the world. The plane forms the foundation of the D&D cosmos and is home to countless elemental beings, including \\Monster{genies}, \\Monster{archons}, and \\Monster{demons}. It\'s also a source of tremendous arcane power, the place where all fireballs and lightning bolts are born.\n\now you can play a hero who harnesses the raw power of the \\Place{Elemental Chaos}. \\Product{Player\'s Option: Heroes of the Elemental Chaos} presents the elementalist sorcerer and the sha\'ir wizard as new class options, as well as new character themes, feats, powers, paragon paths, epic destinies, and elemental companions."
