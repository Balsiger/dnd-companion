  description: "Rampaging \\Monster{dragons} appear in more and more places every day. And if\n                    the soulless \\Monster{lich} \\NPC{Sammaster} gets his way -- and there\'s every\n                    reason to suspect he will -- the disaster has only just begun.\n                    But then all the \\Monster{dragons} have to do to avoid the madness that\n                    drives them to kill is trade their immortal souls for an eternity of undeath.\n                    The knowledge of that unavoidable truth may cause more madness among the\n                    \\Monster{dragons} of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n} than the curse itself. For the\n                    \\Class{dragonslayer} \\NPC{Dorn}, a \\Monster{dragon} is a \\Monster{dragon}\n                    whether or not it has skin. But what if it wears the skin of a woman he\'s\n                    falling in love with?\n                    It\'s shaping up to be a difficult year for \\NPC{Dorn} and his companions, a\n                    year that will bring all of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n} to the edge of\n                    cataclysm. The \\Event{Year of Rogue Dragons} rages on."
