  description: "If a dracolich is slain, its spirit immediately returns to its phylactery. If there is no reptilian corpse within 90 feet for the spirit to possess, it is trapped in the phylactery until such a time --- if ever --- that a corpse becomes available. A dracolish is difficult to destroy. If its spirit is currently contained in its phylactery, destroying that item when a suitable corpse is not within range effectively destorys the dracolich. Likewise, an active dracolich is unable to attempt further possessions if its phylactery is destroyed. The fate of a disembodied dracolich spirit --- that is, a spirit with no body or phylactery --- is unknown, but presumably it is drawn to the \\Place{Lower Planes}."
