  description: "\\Place{Skullport}, the \\Place{Port of Shadows}, is perhaps the best kept secret in all the \\Place{Sword Coast North}. A mile and a half beneath the orderly streets of \\Place{Waterdeep} squats the most wretched and lawless pit of thieves, buccaneers, slavers, and sellswords the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms} has to offer. Under a moldering tangle of catwalks threaded between the stalactites and stalagmites of the cavern city, \\Monster[Illithid]{illithids}, \\Monster[Drow]{drow}, \\Monster[Beholder]{beholders}, and others plot and trade with emissaries from the surface. Monsters prowl the dark recesses and alleyways, gangs of \\Monster[Zombie]{zombies} shamble about performing menial labor, and anything and everything can be bought and sold: lethal poisons, foul tomes of forbidden magic, and slaves. The only law is meted out by the enigmatic \\Group{Skulls of Skullport}, mysterious floating humanoid skulls whose capricious judgments and madness-induced destructiveness are the stuff of grisly travelers\' tales. Gold rules the ever-present twilight, and only those with keen eyes and blades may keep it long. This 96-page book contains: \\list {Maps and general information about the three layers and four wards of \\Place{Skullport}.} {Descriptions of over 100 notable sites in the wards.} {A partial map of the dungeons of \\Place{Skullport}---where the \\Group[Skulls of Skullport]{Skulls} throw the folk they let live!} {Descriptions of notable NPCs and power groups of \\Place{Skullport}.} Although no other \\Place{Forgotten Realms} setting products are required to use \\Product[TSR 11348]{Skullport}, this accessory can be used to provide supplemental information for the \\Product[TSR 1060]{Ruins of Undermountain} campaign expansion. Dungeon Masters can also use \\Product[TSR 11348]{Skullport} as a basis for an \\Place{Underdark} city in their own campaigns."
