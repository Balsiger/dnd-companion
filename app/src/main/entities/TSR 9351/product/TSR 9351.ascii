  description: "\\center{\\emph{\'A village is only as livable as its surroundings. We are\n                    caretakers not only for our homes, but for our world.\'}}\n                    \\right{---\\NPC{Inum}}\n                    Strange sentiments, perhaps, from one who lives in what many perceive as a\n                    frozen wasteland, but the philosopher \\NPC{Inum} speaks for the\n                    \\Group[Ulutiun]{Ulutiun people} of the \\Place{Great Glacier}. Their tribes\n                    share that icy landscape with arctic \\Monster[Dwarf]{dwarves} who enjoy\n                    sunbathing, sled-animals that are hardier than dogs, and fierce montsters\n                    that live nowhere else---and thrive in the freezing air.\n                    \\Product[TSR 9351]{The Great Glacier} is the first supplement for the\n                    \\Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign setting to detail an \\Group{Inuit}-base\n                    culture. In this booklet is fact-based information on building a snow-house,\n                    surviving in sub-zero temperatures for extended periods of time, and more\n                    ideas for fantasy campaigning in an arctic setting. For those who are tired\n                    of the normal, temperate,\n                    \'you-meet-in-the-tavern-and-proceed-to-go-adventuring\' games, here\'s\n                    something completely different.\n                    Make sure your characters dress warmly---it gets nippy at night on the\n                    \\Place{Great Glacier}.\n                    This accessory is suitable for use by all levels of play."
