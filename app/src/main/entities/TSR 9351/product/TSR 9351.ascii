  description: "\\center{\\emph{\'A village is only as livable as its surroundings. We are caretakers not only for our homes, but for our world.\'}} \\right{---\\NPC{Inum}} Strange sentiments, perhaps, from one who lives in what many perceive as a frozen wasteland, but the philosopher \\NPC{Inum} speaks for the \\Group[Ulutiun]{Ulutiun people} of the \\Place{Great Glacier}. Their tribes share that icy landscape with arctic \\Monster[Dwarf]{dwarves} who enjoy sunbathing, sled-animals that are hardier than dogs, and fierce montsters that live nowhere else---and thrive in the freezing air. \\Product[TSR 9351]{The Great Glacier} is the first supplement for the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign setting to detail an \\Group{Inuit}-base culture. In this booklet is fact-based information on building a snow-house, surviving in sub-zero temperatures for extended periods of time, and more ideas for fantasy campaigning in an arctic setting. For those who are tired of the normal, temperate, \'you-meet-in-the-tavern-and-proceed-to-go-adventuring\' games, here\'s something completely different. Make sure your characters dress warmly---it gets nippy at night on the \\Place{Great Glacier}. This accessory is suitable for use by all levels of play."
