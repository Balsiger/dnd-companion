He is more than a wizard, more than the\n                    protector of the \\Place{City of Splendors}, and more than human.\n                    When his consciousness is intermingled with that of his young apprentice they\n                    will learn more from each other than either expected, and go together to a\n                    fate neither could possibly see coming.\n                    Steven E. Schend, one of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} setting\'s most prolific\n                    sages, breathes new life into one of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}\'s most vital mages,\n                    and reveals secrets and lies from a thousand years of Realmslore."
