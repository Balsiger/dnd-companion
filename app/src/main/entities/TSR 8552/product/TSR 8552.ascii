  description: "When \\NPC{Alias} crosses swords with the underlings of the cunning, heartless lord of \\Place{Westgate}\'s criminal guild, known only as \\Group{The Faceless}, he vows to destroy her. Accepting the challenge to rid \\Place{Westgate} of the maleficent \\Group{Night Masks}, \\NPC{Alias} gathers old allies and new: the \\Monster{saurial} paladin \\NPC{Dragonbait}, the \\Monster{hafling} \\NPC{Olive Ruskettle}, the street performer \\NPC{Jamal}, the sage \\NPC{Mintassan}, and the charismatic \\NPC{Victor Dhostar}, son of \\NPC{Westgate}\'s governing official. Yet even as she thwarts the nefarious efforts of the \\Group{Night Masks}, \\NPC{Alias} becomes ever more entangled in the web woven by \\Group{The Faceless}, a web whose silken strands are spun from intrigue, political machinations---and murder. \\Product{Masquerades} is the tenth in an open-ended series of novels focusing on the \\Group{Harpers}, the secret organization for Good in the Place{Forgotten Realms} fantasy world."
