  description: "The ultimate struggle of good and evil...At stake, the survival of the \\Place{Moonshae Isles}. \\NPC{Tristan Kendrick}, newly crowned High King of the \\Group{Ffolk}, must forge a lasting alliance between the divergent peoples of the \\Place{Isles}. The \\Class{druid} \\NPC{Robyn} must confront an evil that has infested the land itself. And together, they must decide if they will face the future as king and queen---or as enemies, forever separated by failure and mistrust. Filled with bizarre creatures and cast against a landscape such as the \\Place{Isles} have never seen, \\Product{Darkwell} is the tumultuous conclusion to the epic begun in Doubles Nile\'s best-selling \\Product{Darkwalker on Moonshae} and \\Product{Black Wizards}. The \\Place{Moonshae} Trilogy is part of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} adventures, TSR\'s most extensive fantasy campaign."
