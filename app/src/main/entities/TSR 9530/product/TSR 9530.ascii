Rumors blame an insidious thieves\' guild called the \\Group{Unblinking Eye} for this turn of events. Why would the \\Group{Unblinking Eye} with to \'take care\' of the mage? Why does the guild want to speak to anyone involved with \\NPC{Velinax}? Finally, what dark goal does the guild truly intend to accomplish?
