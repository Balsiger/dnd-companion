  description: "Life is good for \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden}, better than it ever has been for the beleaguered \\Monster{dark elf}. His dearest friend, the \\Monster{dwarf} \\NPC{Bruenor}, has reclaimed his throne, and his adventuring companions, \\NPC{Wulfgar} and \\NPC{Catti-brie}, are to be wed in the spring. Even the \\Monster{halfling} \\NPC{Regis} has returned. All the friends are united in the safety and prosperity of \\Place{Mithril Hall}, where streams of silver mithril run deep and \\Monster{dwarven} hammers bang out the solemn rhythms of ancient and unending songs. But \\NPC{Drizzt} did not achieve this state of peace without leaving powerful enemies in his wake. \\God{Lloth}, the dreaded \\God{Spider Queen} deity of the evil \\Monster{dark elves}, counts herself among them an has vowed to end the drow\'s days of pleasant security."
