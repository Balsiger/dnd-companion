  description: "\\NPC{Doji Hoturi}, the young Champion of the \\Group{Crane}, is everything a \\Class{samurai} could wish to be: swift of sword and pure of heart . . . but his eyes hide a terrible secret. Bloody magic whispers through \\Place{Rokugan}\'s greatest cities, and the undead servants of a Dark God rise. From the shadows, \\NPC{Doji Hoturi} watches as a new champion of evil lifts his sword and laughs -- and the face beneath the armor is his own."
