  description: "Something evil is stalking the parish of \\Place{Barlox}. Ten years ago, the village\'s temple burned to the ground and the parish priest disappeared. The temple has since been rebuilt, but life has not returned to normal. A current of fear and discontent now ripples beneath the surface of this once sleepy wine-making community. Old rivalries have turned bitter, and unwittingly unleashed a force of ancient corruption. \\Product{Cleric\'s Challenge II} is a special One-on-One Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for a Dungeon Master and one player character cleric of 4th to 6th level. It is the eighth in a series of independent adventures focusing on an individual player of a specific class."
