A wintry grave awaits those who venture\n                    forth unprepared, whether traveling through polar regions and frozen\n                    mountaintops to ice-glazed dungeons, or the \\Place{Ice Wastes} of the\n                    \\Place{Abyss}.\n                    This supplement for the D&D game explores the impact of arctic conditions and\n                    extreme cold-weather environments on every aspect of game play. Along with\n                    rules for adapting to, navigating through, and surviving hazardous\n                    cold-weather conditions and terrain, Frostburn also includes new spells,\n                    feats, magic items, prestige classes, and monsters associated with icy\n                    realms.\n                    To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master needs the \\Product{Player\'s\n                    Handbook} and \\Product{Dungeon Master\'s Guide}. A player needs only the\n                    \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}."
