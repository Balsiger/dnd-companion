  description: "Sweltering temperatures, bone-scouring windstorms, and other dangers\n                    threaten explorers in waste environments. From arid deserts and volcanic\n                    regions to ash-choked dungeons and the lava-filled layers of \\Place{Gehenna},\n                    unwary travelers may fall victim to the unrelenting hazards that await.\n                    This supplement for the D&D game explores the impact of desert conditions and\n                    extreme hot-weather environments on every aspect of game play. Along with\n                    rules for adapting to, navigating through, and surviving hazardous\n                    hot-weather conditions and terrain, \\Product{Sandstorm} also includes new\n                    races, spells, feats, magic items, prestige classes, and monsters associated\n                    with deserts and other wastelands.\n                    To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the \\Product{Player\'s\n                    Handbook} and \\Product{Dungeon Master\'s Guide}. A player needs only the\n                    \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}."
