  description: "When the \\Group{Harpers} judged the \\NPC{Nameless Bard} responsible for the death of his apprentices, they sentenced him to exile and obscurity. Now the \\Group{Harpers} are reconsidering their decision, but with the arrival of the monster \\Monster{Grypht}, \\NPC{Nameless}\'s new trial dissolves in a string of disappearances and murder. It is up to the bard\'s friends, \\NPC{Alias} the swordswoman, \\NPC{Akabar} the mage, \\NPC{Dragonbait} the paladin, and \\NPC{Ruskettle} the thief, to prove one enemy is behind all the chaos---the ancient evil god, \\God{Moander the Darkbringer}. Unless \\NPC{Alias} and her companions can find \\NPC{Nameless} and convince him to sacrifice some of his precious power, \\God{Moander} will return to claim the \\Place{Realms}. \\Product{Song of Saurials} is Kate Novak and Jeff Grubb\'s exciting conclusion to the \\Product{Finder\'s Stone Trilogy}, set in the \\Product{Forgotten Realms} fantasy world from TSR, Inc."
