  description: "\\emph{The rubble-strewn passageway twists and turns, winding ever deeper\n                    into the mountain, lower and lower into the bowels of the ancient, forbidding\n                    halls of long-dead \\Monster[Dwarf]{dwarves}. The torchlight flickers,\n                    threatening to succumb to the oppressive darkness. Creeping along one\n                    striated granite wall, \\NPC{Arikus} the warrior moves cautiously toward the\n                    great cavern ahead, its sides and walls disappearing into the gloomy\n                    distance. Cocking his head to one side to listen, he holds his hand up for a\n                    moment, demanding unconditional quiet from his companions. Then, his arm\n                    relaxing in relief, he waves everyone forward and moves into the open. Before\n                    him, scattered to the far walls of the enormous cavern, are piles upon piles\n                    of glittering treasure---coins from countless kingdoms, sparkling gems,\n                    exquisite jewelry, and items of wondrous power---enough for twenty kings\'\n                    ransoms. \\NPC{Arikus} laughs gleefully, thrusting both hands into the nearest\n                    cache of coins to let them run through his fingers. At that moment, a\n                    monstrous shadow looms threateningly over him. Looking up, \\NPC{Arikus}\n                    blanches and stumbles back in horror before the terrible visage of a\n                    \\Monster[Red Dragon]{Great Red Wyrm}. The fearsome \\Monster[Dragon]{dragon}\n                    opens its razor-filled maw and spews forth a gout of white-hot flame,\n                    engulfing the hapless warrior...}\n                    The ultimate Dungeon Master fantasy! This is \\emph{the} most deluxe dungeon,\n                    designed to appeal to discriminating and demanding role-players. Adventurers,\n                    beware. This is more than just a \\Monster[Dragon]{dragon} hunt. Within the\n                    lair of this beast lie cruel and deadly traps, befuddling conundrums and\n                    puzzles, and cunning minions that will be the end of overconfident or\n                    careless adventurers. Inside this box there are:\n                    \\list\n                    {Three 64-page books, compromising two adventures that link into one\n                    super-campaign}\n                    {12 full-color reference cards}\n                    {16 special player handouts}\n                    {Eight \\Product[Monster Compendium]{Monstrous Compendium} sheets}\n                    {A sheet of cardstock standups with 24 plastic bases}\n                    {Six full-color poster maps, two of which link together to make a giant\n                    tactical playing surface for use with miniatures or the included\n                    cardstock figures}"
