  description: "Groundlings have no idea, but any spelljamming adventurer worth his salt\n  knows the universe is \\emph{huge}! Let \\Product{Practical Planetology} open\n  new possibilities for your AD&D \\Place{Spelljammer} campaign.\n\n  Herein find fifteen unique planets, exotic and mysterious, ripe for plunder\n  or other less profitable adventures. Weigh anchor at the air world of\n  \\Place{Alabeth}, and float with marooned \\Monster{elves} atop their massive\n  \\Item{holbags}. Visit the \\Monster{mithril dragons} of \\Place{Radole} who\n  ride the hot thermals over lakes of molten tin. Endure the searing flames of\n  the \\Monster{efreeti} city on \\Place{Ignia}, or swim among the island\n  necrocracies---nations of undead from a destroyed planet---on\n  \\Place{Charon}.\n\n  These and other bizarre worlds of adventure await you in \\Product{Practical\n  Planetology}, along with beasts native to them, eleven new monsters in\n  all. All you\'ll need is a ship, a \\Item{helm}, and a start to steer them\n  by!\n\n  \\Product{Practical Planetology} contains material suitable for characters of\n  any level."
