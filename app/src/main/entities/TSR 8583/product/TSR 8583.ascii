  description: "Before the \\Event{Dawn Cataclysm}, \\God{Moander the Darkbringer} corrupted \\God{Tyche}, \\God{Goddess of Luck}. In a desperate attempt to preserve \\God{Tyche}\'s goodness, the gods clove her in twain, creating two daughter goddesses: \\God{Tymora}, \\God{Lady Luck}; and \\God{Beshaba}, \\God{Lady Doom}. In the eons since then, the two sisters have existed in total enmity. Now a great power has hatched a mad scheme to re-create the goddess \\God{Tyche} by reuniting \\God{Tymora} and \\God{Beshaba}, regardless of the potentially calamitous consequences. In a decision fraught with godly intrigue, \\NPC{Joel}, \\NPC{the Rebel Bard}, priest of \\God{Finder}, is chosen to uncover whoever is behind the abduction of the sister goddesses. Aided by his old allies, \\NPC{Holly Harrowslough} and \\NPC{Jas}, and his new friend, the \\Monster{kender} \\NPC{Emilo Haversack}, \\NPC{Joel} must find a way to prevent the merger of \\God{Tymora} and \\God{Beshaba} before disaster overtakes the luckless \\Place{Realms}. The \\Place{Forgotten Realms} meet \\Place{Dragonlance} meet \\Place{Planescape} in a heart-stopping adventure that spans three worlds."
