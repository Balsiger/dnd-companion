  description: "The \\Group{Knights of Solamnia} were the greatest order of chivalry in the\n  history of \\Place{Krynn}.\n\n  All those who wish to become \\Class{Solamnic Knights} must first enter as\n  \\Class{squires} of the \\Group{Knights of the Crown}, with whom they begin\n  their training in the virtue of loyalty.\n\n  This is the story of \\NPC{Sir Pirvan the Wayward}, whose reluctant and\n  inauspicious beginnings as \\NPC{Pirvan the Spell Thief} bore few clues to his\n  potential as a \\Group{Knight of the Crown}.\n\n  Roland J. Green is the author of the \\Product{Starcruiser Shennandoa} and\n  \\Product{Wandor} series and numerous \\Product{Conan} novels, and is coauthor\n  (with Jerry Pournelle) of the \\Product{Jannisaries} series.\n\n  \\Product{The Warriors} series details the exploits of the heroes and villains\n  of the \\Event{War of the Lance}."
