  description: "A quth-maren is a revolting undead creature created by clerics of \\God{Kiaransalee}. These clerics enjoy flaying their enemies - removing every scrap of skin - and then animating them in this hideous form.\n\nA quth-maren bears the overall form it did in life, but it has not skin or exposed fat - just muscles over its skeleton. Caustic blood constantly oozes from its body. Unlike zombies, to which they bear a certain resemblance, quth-marens are neither mindless nor prone to decomposition."

encounter: "A quth-maren bears the overall form it did in life, but it has not skin or exposed fat - just muscles over its skeleton. Caustic blood constantly oozes from its body. "
combat: "Quth-marens fight fiercely but cleverly, making the best use of their ranged attacks and gaze attacks before closing with their opponents. In groups, they tend to gang up on a single enemy at a time, rather than distributing their attacks among a group of opponents."
