  description: "A keening spirit is shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Any creature within a 60-foot radius that looks at it must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 keening spirit\'s HD + keening spirit\'s Charisma modifier) or be affected as though by a fearspell cast by a sorcerer of the keening spirit\'s character level."
