  description: "A keening spirit\'s most dreaded weapon is its wail or keen. This ability functions like the wail of the banshee spell, but it affects any number of creatures within a 30-foot spread centered on the keening spirit. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 keening spirit\'s HD + keening spirit\'s Charisma modifier) negates the effect. A keening spirit can use this ability only once per day. "
