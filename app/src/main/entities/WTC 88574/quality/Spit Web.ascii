A Large or smaller creature hit by this attack is entangled (\342\200\2232 on attack rolls, \342\200\2234 penalty to Dexterity, unable to move). An entangled creature attempting to cast a spell must succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15) to do so. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check (DC 26) or burst the web with a Strength check (DC 32). Both are standard actions. Once the golem spits a web, it can\342\200\231t spit another one until 1d4 rounds later."
