  description: "With a successful Control Shape check, Thelossa can assume the form of a dire bat as a full-round action.  Upon assuming her dire bat form, she regains hit points as if she had rested for a day. If slain, she reverts to her drow form, though she remains dead. However, any part of her body that is separated from the whole retains its animal form."
