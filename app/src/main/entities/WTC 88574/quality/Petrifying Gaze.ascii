  description: "The creature can turn a target within 30 feet that meets its gaze to stone permanently. A successful Fortitude save (DC $dc) negates the effect. Each opponent within range of its gaze attack must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of that opponent\'s turn in initiative order. The creature can also actively gaze as an attack action by choosing a target within range, who must then attempt a saving throw.\n\nAverting ones eyes gives a 50% change to avoid the gaze but also gives the creature concealment (20% miss chance). \n\nTurning one\'s back to the creature or wearing a blindfold gives a 100% change to avoid the gaze but gives the creature total concealment (50% miss chance, can attack assumed square only, no attacks of Opportunity)."
