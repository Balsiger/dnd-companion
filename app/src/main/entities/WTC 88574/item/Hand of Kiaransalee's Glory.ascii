  description: "Very similar to the \\Item{hand of glory} described in the \\Product{DUNGEON MASTER\342\200\231s Guide}, this item is a mummified drow hand with a silver ring on each finger. As with the hand of glory, a magic ring placed on one of the fingers (as a replacement for one of the silver rings) functions normally for the character who wears the hand.\n\nIn addition, each of the five silver rings allows the wearer of the hand to use a specific spell effect. Each ring can produce one of the following effects once per day: \\Reference{spell}{deeper darkness}, \\Reference{spell}{see invisibility}, \\Reference{spell}{ray of enfeeblement}, \\Reference{spell}{chill touch}, and \\Reference{spell}{spectral hand}. \n\nIf the wearer replaces one of the five silver rings with another magic ring, he or she must sacrifice one of these spell effects in order to replace it with the magic ring\342\200\231s power. If removed from the hand, the silver rings have no magical power."
