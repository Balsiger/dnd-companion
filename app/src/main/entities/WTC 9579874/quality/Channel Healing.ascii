    "By expending one daily use of your ability to turn undead and channeling that energy toward "
    "a willing ally, you can cast any \\Spell{cure} spell as a swift action, or you can cast "
    "\\Spell{cure} spell on a target up to 30 feet away. You can do both in the same round, but "
    "doing so expends two daily uses of your ability to turn undead."
