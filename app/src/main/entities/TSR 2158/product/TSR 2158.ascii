  description: "Back again, and better than ever! Virtually all new AD&D game monsters that\n                    were published by TSR in 1994 have growled, burrowed, and slithered their way\n                    into this second release in a yearly series of Monstrous Compendium\n                    supplements.\n                    More than 100 denizens of land, sky, sea, and ... other places ... are\n                    collected inside. Most of these creatures originally appeared in a specific\n                    AD&D campaign setting, but they\'ve all been updated and edited so they can be\n                    used in any campaign.\n                    This year\'s collection also features the return of long out-of-print\n                    \\Monster{dinosaurs} and \\Monster{pleistocene creatures}, and includes general\n                    encounter tables for the Monstrous Compendium books.\n                    This richly illustrated book is an essential addition to every Dungeon\n                    Master\'s library."
