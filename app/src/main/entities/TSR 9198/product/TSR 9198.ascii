  description: "This is the second in a series of ground-breaking AD&D accessories. Within these pages are nearly 70 fully developed adventures that can be inserted into any campaign. They are ready-to-play challenges for all levels of characters. DMs need not spend long hours creating diversions for their players---we\'ve done it for you. If you have \\Product{The Bookd of Lairs}, you already know what you\'ll find herein. These mini-adventures are arranged by terrain type (city, desert, hills, mountains, forest, etc.), with monsters in alphabetical order for easy access. At the back of the book is a combined monsters statistics table, showing all the necessary figures at a glance. These are familiar monsters (like the \\Monster{gnome}, \\Monster{brownie}, and \\Monster{ettin}) and not-so-familiar ones (like the \\Monster{bakemono} and \\Monster{tengu}), from both original AD&D sources and the \\Product{Oriental Adventures} book. Some of these mini-adventures are mere diversions; others can turn into minor campaigns! In any case, DMs and players alike are sure to be pleased with \\Product{The Book of Lairs II}."
