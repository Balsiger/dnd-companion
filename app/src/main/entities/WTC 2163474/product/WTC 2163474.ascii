  description: "The \\Monster{lich} \\NPC{Nathifa} has stolen the mystic \\Item{dragonwand} and intends to use it to summon an army of \\Monster{weresharks} to ravage the \\Place{Lhazaar Principalities} in the name of the \\NPC{Lich Queen Vol}. To stop her, assassin-turned-priest \\NPC{Diran Bastiaan} must defeat a \\Monster{demon} that holds a city in its thrall, contend with a \\Monster{werewolf} whose only wish is to die, and survive deadly peril on the fabled isle of \\Place{Trebaz Sinara}. \\NPC{Diran} will need all his faith, a brace of well-honed \\Item{daggers}, and more than a little luck to succeed. For if he fails, the \\Placa{Principalities} will be swept away in a sea of death."
