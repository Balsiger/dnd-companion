  description: "Its waters are the deep purple of the most precious \\Item[Amethyst]{amethyst}; its shores hold some of the most dangerous locations in \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}. It is the \\Place{Moonsea}, home to Zhentil Keep, the \\Place{Citadel of the Raven}, and thousands of ordinary folk who merely want to make an honest living. Hark the words of \\NPC{Melandryll Belarod}, the bard who writings from the bulk of this material. He has experienced firsthand the horrors of ruined \\Place{Hulburg}, the desolation of \\Place{Sulasspryn}, and the stench of \\Place{Mulmaster}. His travels aboard the \\Item{Devawing} have produced this chronicle of the towns and people of the \\Place{Moonsea}, including both havens and dangers. \\NPC[Melandryll Belarod]{Belarod} knows of the \\Place{Citadel of the Raven}, a ten-mile-long series of fortresses and barracks, site of a terrifying betrayal. He also has evaded the \\Group{Zhentilar}, the crack forces garrisoned at \\Place{Zhentil Keep}. In this product are a 64-page \\emph{Reference Guide} for the Dungeon Master, a 32-page \\emph{Player\'s Guide}, and a four-color poster map of the Place{Moonsea} region."
