  description: "I shall burn thee with hunger, devour thee with blistering heat and with\n                    bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of beasts upon thee, with the\n                    poison of serpents of the dust.\n                    The spiritual heart of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n} beats in time with a hundred\n                    gods, and for each there are a thousand servants or more: \\Product{The\n                    Priests}.\n                    Lady of Poison is the first title in a new \\Place{Forgotten Realms} novel\n                    series focusing specifically on priests, the popular D&D game iconic class\n                    also known as clerics.
