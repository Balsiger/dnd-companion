  description: "\\large{The Next March Wasn\'t Due For Another 189 Years. Try Telling That To\n                    The \\Monster{Modrons}.}\n                    \\emph{On a regular schedule, the \\Group{Great Modron March} spills out of\n                    \\Place{Mechanus} and the lawful automatons file their way around the\n                    \\Place{Great Ring}. No one knows why they do it, but everyone stays out of\n                    their way---because when the \\Monster{modrons} march, they\'ll walk right over\n                    a berk who doesn\'t know enough to move aside.\n                    But \\emph{this} March has started decades before it was supposed to begin,\n                    and that\'s even more of a mystery. Caught unprepared, the planes shudder\n                    under the \\Monster{modrons\'} collective footsteps---and even the\n                    \\Monster{modrons} themselves seem a little out of sorts.}\n                    \\Product{The Great Modron March} anthology features 11 adventures for\n                    characters ranging from 1st to 10th level as well as new information about\n                    the \\Monster{modrons} of \\Place{Mechanus}. Each adventure can be played\n                    separately or linked together to form an extended campaign. The\n                    \\Monster{modron} procession touches every \\Place{Outer Plane} in turn---and\n                    it isn\'t always welcome. On their unswerving path, the \\Monster{clockwork\n                    creatures} will destroy \\Monster{celestial} towns, be attacked by evil\n                    knights intent on using \\Monster{modron} parts in foul experiments, and lead\n                    characters onto the deadly plains of the \\Place{Abyss} and into the famous\n                    prime-material labyrinth of \\Place{Undermountain}. Without help, they\'ll be\n                    lost in the swirling chaos of \\Place{Limbo} or even fail to complete the\n                    March entirely. And along their route, every blood on the planes seeks the\n                    answer to the most important question: Why have the \\Monster{modrons}\n                    abandoned their normal, lawful schedule to march years before they\'re due?\n                    The \\Event{Modron March} is a once-in-a-lifetime event for any\n                    adventurer---and the player characters can participate every step of the\n                    way!"
