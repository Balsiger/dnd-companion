  description: "The name \\NPC{Guerrand DiThon} has been cursed by his family since the day\n  he disappeaered. When a mysterious plague strikes their beleaguered village,\n  \\NPC{Guerrand}\'s name is invoked again -- as the cause of the disaster.\n\n  \\NPC{Bram DiThon}, \\NPC{Guerrand}\'s nephew, is more like his uncle than the\n  family would care to admit. A skilled herbalist, \\NPC{Bram} has unknowingly\n  turned his skills toward magic. It is to \\NPC{Bram} the villagers turn when\n  the plague changes their eyes to onyx, their limbs to snakes, and their flesh\n  to stone.\n\n  Unable to stop the unexplainable deaths, \\NPC{Bram} sets out to find his\n  missing uncle. He learns that \\NPC{Guerrand} is the High Defender of\n  \\Place{Bastion}, the last stronghold before the \\Place{Lost Citadel}. But in\n  finding him, \\NPC{Bram} has unwittingly given an evil \\Class{mage} -- once\n  \\NPC{Guerrand}\'s friend, now his archenemy -- the key to destroy the three\n  orders of sorcery.\n\n  \\Product{The Medusa Plague} is the second in the \\Product{Defenders of Magic\n  Trilogy}, a series by \\Place{Dragonlance} saga author Mary Kirchoff that will\n  explore for the first time many of the secrets of sorcery in the world of\n  \\Place{Krynn}."
