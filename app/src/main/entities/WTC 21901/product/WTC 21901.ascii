  description: "The second son of the \\Group{Uskevren} family fights a deadly battle within himself. Like most young men of his station, \\NPC{Talbot} spends his days honing his swordfighting skills and, unlike the others, practicing the art of acting. Now, \\NPC{Talbot} will put both of these talents to the test when a rival house comes looking for blood. The only way for \\NPC{Talbot} to survive against the \\Group{Black Brotherhood} is to let the inner \\Monster{wolf} loose, and the only way from him to live in \\Place{Selgaunt}\'s society is to keep the \\Monster{wolf} chained."
