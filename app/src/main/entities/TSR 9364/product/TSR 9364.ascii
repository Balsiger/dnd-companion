  world: "Ravenloft"
  description: "Of all the inhospitable domains in the \\Place{Ravenloft} campaign world, \\Place{Bluetspur} is the cruelest and most gruesome. Nothing grows in the endless night, and lightning periodically falls like rain. The only place to escape those stormes is inside the \\Monster{mind flayers}\' complex under \\Place{Mt. Makab}, but that is the last place where any sane person would want to go. The High Master \\Monster{Illithid} has been hatching black plots by hatching vampiric \\Monster{mind flayers} in his laboratories! His prodigies are horribly insane, but if he can complete his plans, he will achieve a new level of dark immortality. A pair of heroes has stolen the key to his success, but they have paid a heavy price for the bravery and are in desperate need of aid unlooked for. Meanwhile, the \\NPC{Lord of the Realm} watches over the proceedings and plays havoc with the wits of both sides, sapping strength and will with all-powerful thoughts of darkness. A party of adventurers will need all of their skills to escape this black domain without the loss of life, power, or sanity! For 4 to 6 players, levels 12-15."
