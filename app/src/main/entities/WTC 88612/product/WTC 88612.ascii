Their only clue in this\n                    life-and-death hunt is the mark of the barbarian\'s lost \\Item{warhammer}\n                    \\Item{Aegis-fang}, found branded on the back of a vicious outlaw. As they\n                    travel along the reaches of the \\Place{Sword Coast}, the companions grapple\n                    with the puzzle \\NPC{Wulfgar}\'s life has become, and they slowly uncover the\n                    terrible pain that lies at its center."
