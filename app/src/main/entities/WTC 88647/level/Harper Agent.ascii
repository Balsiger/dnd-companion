    "The semisecret organization known as the \\Group{Harpers} has members scattered all across "
    "Faer√ªn. These individuals are dedicated to battling evil, discovering and preserving "
    "forgotten lore, and maintaining the balance between nature and civilization. \\Group{Harper} "
    "agents are the 'field agents' of the \\Group{Harper} organization, acting directly to gather "
    "intelligence and eliminate threats to the greater good. Equally adept at operating alone or "
    "in small groups, Harper agents display a versatility that few others can match."
    "\\par "
    "\\Class{Bards} are the most common candidates for the \\Class{Harper agent} prestige class, "
    "but they are by no means the only qualified characters. \\Class{Rangers}, \\Class{rogues}, "
    "\\Class{sorcerers}, and \\Class{wizards} all possess the diversity of skill and ability "
    "necessary to become \\Class{Harper agents}. \\Class{Clerics}, especially of \\God{Deneir}, "
    "\\God{Lliira}, and \\God{Tymora}, are occasionally found in the ranks of this prestige class, "
    "as are \\Class{druids} and \\Class{monks}. \\Class{Barbarians}, \\Class{fighters}, and "
    "\\CLass{paladins} rarely become \\Class{Harper agents} because they lack the subtlety for "
    "the work."
