  description:
    "The Harper can access knowledge in the same manner as a \\Class{bard} can. This ability "
    "functions like the \\Quality{bardic knowledge} ability, except that the bonus for the check "
    "equals [[$count + $intelligence_modifier]]. If the Harper has another such lore ability from "
    "another source (such as \\Class{bard} or loremaster levels), his Harper agent levels stack "
    "with levels of all other classes that grant such an ability for the purpose of Harper "
    "knowledge checks."
