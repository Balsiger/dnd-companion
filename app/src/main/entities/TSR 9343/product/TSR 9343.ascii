  description: "Hundreds of years ago, the \\Monster{elves} and \\Monster{goblinkin} faought\n  for control of known space in the \\Event{Unhuman War}. The \\Monster{elves}\n  emerged victorious and the \\Monster{goblinkin} were driven out to lick their\n  wounds and plot revenge for another day.\n\n  The day has come.\n\n  After centuries of plotting and building, a new race of advanced\n  \\Monster{orcs} known as the \\Monster{scro} have rallied the\n  \\Monster{goblins}, \\Monster{hobgoblins}, and \\Monster{kobolds}. It is only a\n  matter of time before they infiltrate known space to wreak destruction on the\n  inhabited planets.\n\n  The \\Monster{elves} are looking for a few good adventurers to infiltrate a\n  \\Monster{scro} base and steal any information valuable to the war\n  effort. Your PCs are offered the chance to become heroes---or die trying.\n\n  \\Product{Goblins\' Return} is a 64-page adventure set in the \\Event{second\n  Unhuman War}. The first of a two-part module series, it can later be linked\n  with \\Product{Heart of the Enemy} or it can be played as a stand-alone\n  adventure.\n\n  \\Product{Goblins\' Return}  is designed for  four to six characters  of levels\n  7-10."
