  description: "The \\Place[Vilhon Reach]{Reach} has always been considered the breadbasket\n                    of the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}, the birthplace of countless warriors\n                    who have shed their lifeblood on the fields of battle. It\'s also home to\n                    noble families that have ruled kingdoms for countless generations,\n                    \\Monster[Lizardman]{lizardman} cities that have existed for hundreds of\n                    years, and an ancient plague that still haunts the land.\n                    Take a trip to \\Place{Hlondeth}, the \\Monster[Yuan-ti]{yuan-ti} city that\n                    stands like an emerald beacon over the waters of \\Place[Vilhon\n                    Reach]{Vilhon}. Visit the gladiatorial arena of \\Place{Hlath} or plunge into\n                    the depths of the \\Place{Deepwash}. Feel the political tension that hovers\n                    over \\Place{Shining Arrabar} like a poised dagger. But always remember that\n                    in the \\Place[Vilhon Reach]{Reach}, as in all lands that adventurers tread,\n                    not all is as it appears.\n                    This \\Place{Forgotten Realms} \\Product[TSR 1085]{campaign} accessory contains\n                    a full-color poster map of the \\Place{Vilhon Reach} as well as new artwork\n                    that brings the \\Place[Vilhon Reach]{Reach} to life. A 64-page accessory for\n                    the Dungeon Master details the lengthy history of the \\Place[Vilhon\n                    Reach]{Vilhon}, as well as providing current information on the various\n                    countries and city-states. A 32-page travelogue provides background for\n                    players whose characters would try their hand at adventuring in the\n                    \\Place{Vilhon Reach}."
