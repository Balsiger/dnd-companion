  description: "A journey through the unforgiving expanse of the endless \\Place{Abyss}\n                    awaits. At the end of that journey a ragged band of \\Monster{dark elves} hope\n                    to find \\God{Lolth} herself. Though they\'ve managed to survive the fall of\n                    \\Place{Ched Nasad}, the \\Monster{demon}-haunted ruins of \\Place{Myth\n                    Drannor}, and the vicious cunning of \\Monster{aboleth} slave-masters, the\n                    \\Place{Underdark} is child\'s play compared to the chaotic infinity of the\n                    \\Place{Demonweb Pits}. They\'ll go to find the truth but may well find only\n                    \\Product{Annihilation}.\n                    The fifth novel in an epic six-part series from the fertile imagination of\n                    R.A.
