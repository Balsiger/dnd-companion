  description: "New rules and new figures make an all-new Starter Set. The rulebooks, components, and configuration of this latest Starter Set have all been modified to introduce those unfamiliar with D&D or miniatures gaming to basic skirmish concepts in an easy yet fun manner. Key changes include a new \'Start Here\' rulebook that takes a step-by-step approach to terms, battle tactics, and other game elements. This rulebook also features the two fixed miniatures that are now found in every Starter Set, allowing every purchaser the same learning experience right out of the box. Two full-color, double-sided maps supply vital play surfaces and also make a great visual impact. In addition to new components, the overall game rules have been updated to facilitate faster gameplay and encourage larger battles. Rules have been adjusted to accommodate any size figure, from tiny to huge and even beyond, and will be compatible with any D&D Miniatures Game release. Per previous releases, the figures in the set are selected from key D&D roleplaying games titles such as Monster Manual, Monster Manual III, Miniatures Handbook, and the Eberron and Forgotten Realms campaign settings. The set also includes an elite group of figures that come with a second, epic-level stat card, allowing players to assemble higher-value armies with which to do battle."
