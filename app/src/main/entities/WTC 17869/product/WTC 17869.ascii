  description: "The world of the \\Place{Eberron} settings holds many wonders beyond the\n  soaring spires of \\Place{Sharn}. Explorers who chase distant horizons might\n  find themselves infiltrating the \\Monster{demon}-haunted city of\n  \\Place{Ashtakala}, prowling the jungles of \\Place{Xen\'drik}, snatching relics\n  from the \\Place{City of the Dead}, or invading a \\Monster{dragon} observatory\n  in the mountains of \\Place{Argonnessen}. The secrets of an entire world are\n  within your reach, but be warned: Glory and peril walk hand in hand, and a\n  journey\'s end can come sooner than you think!\n\n  This book gives players everything they need to explore a variety of sites\n  across \\Place{Eberron}, including modes of travel, exploring tips, and rules\n  for joining organizations such as the prestigious \\Group{Wayfinder\n  Foundation}. For Dms, the book describes several likely \'launching pads\' and\n  destinations, complete with maps, ready-to-play encounters, and pregenerated\n  NPCs. \\Product{Explorer\'s Handbook} also provides rules and maps for various\n  modes of transport, including \\Item{lightning trail coaches} and\n  \\Item{elemental-bound vessels}.\n\n  The ultimate sourcebook for players wishing to explore the world of\n  \\Place{Eberron}.\n\n  The \\Product{Explorer\'s Handbook} showcases the multi-continental aspect of\n  the \\Place{Eberron} setting. The chapter on travel discusses instantaneous\n  and played-out travel and provides deck plans for \\Item{airships}, the\n  \\Item{lightning rail}, and \\Item{galleons}, plus other methods of\n  conveyance. A chapter on Explorer\'s Essentials offers information\n  on travel papers, preassembled equipment kits, how to join the\n  \\Group{Wayfarers\' Foundation}, and more. This handbook will encourage you\n  to explore the entire world rather than remain fixed in one region."
