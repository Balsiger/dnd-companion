  description: "In part one of the \\Product[Randal Morn Trilogy]{Randal Morn trilogy}, \\Product[TSR 8484]{The Sword of the Dales}, the legendary leader of \\Place{Daggerdale}, \\NPC{Randal Morn}, was captured by unknown assailants as he sought to regain the great weapon for which that adventure was named. A stalwart band of young and enthusiastic heroes was recruited to ride to his aid, yet all they recovered was the \\Item[The Sword of the Dales]{Sword} itself and a message: \'Seek me in \\Place[Spiderhaunt Woods]{Spiderhaunt Wood}\'. In the second part of the trilogy, \\Product[TSR 9485]{The Secret of Spiderhaunt}, those same adventurers found \\NPC[Randal Morn]{Randal} and freed him briefly, yet he was almost as quickly torn from their grasp by an agent of the evil \\Group{Zhentarim}, seeking to end the threat of \\NPC{Randal Morn}\'s return to power. In this final episode, the heroes must follow the kidnapper\'s trail and rescued \\NPC{Randal Morn} before the \\Group{Zhentarim} finish interrogating him and the axe falls upon his neck. Armed with the \\Item[The Sword of the Dales]{Sword of the Dales} and aided by a powerful magical spirit that lives within the weapon, the heroes must march into the heart of \\Group{Zhent} occupied \\Place{Dagger Falls}, free \\NPC{Randal Morn}, and save the city from utter destruction. The job is dangerous---perhaps more than the heroes can handle---yet those who would live in songs and legends cannot concern themselves with living to a ripe old age! This is the final part of a trilogy of modules that began with \\Product[TSR 9484]{The Sword of the Dales} and \\Product[TSR 9485]{The Secret of Spiderhaunt}."
