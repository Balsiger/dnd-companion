  description: "Ten years ago, a comic strip called \\Product{Dork Tower} made a quiet start in a magazine called \\Product{Shadis}. Soon moving to other venues, comic books, and web sites, \\Product{Dork Tower} became one of the longest-running, most critically-acclaimed and (most importantly) geekiest gaming comic strips out there. \\Product[DSP 216]{Dork Decade} collects every comic strip from \\Product{Shadis} and \\Product{Dragon} magazines of the strip\'s first decade, chronologically and in color for the first time, along with notes, sketches and much more. Give in to the Dork size! HUZZAH!"
