  description: "\\emph{\'I have been a fan of Elaine Cunningham\'s since I read \\Product{Elfshadow}, because of her lyrical writing style and characters possessed of more than two dimenions.\' \\right{R.A. Salvatore}} The child\'s mother will be leaving this house\', \\NPC{Gromph Baenre} told the \\Monster{elf}-size \\Monster{golem}. \'See to it, and inform her family that she met with an unfortunate accident on the way to the \\Place{Bazaar}. The stone servant bowed and then disappeared into the wall as easily as a \\Monster{wraith} might pass through a fog bank. A moment later, the scream of a \\Monster{drow} female came from a nearby chamber---a scream that began in terror and ended in a liquid gurgle. \\NPC{Gromph} leaned forward and blew out the candle, for darkness best revealed the character of the \\Monster{drow}. All light fled the room, and the archmage\'s eyes changed from amber to brilliant red as his vision slipped into the head-reading spectrum. \'Your are \\NPC{Liriel Baenre}, my daughter and a noble of the First House of \\Place{Menzoberranzan}\', he announced, and then sat back to study the child\'s reaction. The crimson glow of head and warmth drained from her face, and her tiny, pale-knuckled hands gripped the edge of the desk for support. It was clear that the little \\Monster{drow} understood all that had just occurred. Her expression remained stoic, however, and her voice was firm when she repeated her new name. \\NPC{Gromph} nodded approvingly. \\NPC{Liriel} had accepted the reality of the situation---she could hardly do otherwise and survive---yet the rage and frustration of an untamed spirit burned bright in her eyes. This was his daughter, indeed."
