Tried in a \\Monster{gnomish} court for an unfortunate accident and sentenced to spend months at the bottom of \\Place{Mt. Nevermind} tuning \\Item{gnomeflingers}, young \\NPC{Innova} makes an incredible discovery. The whole \\Monster{gnomish} society is changed by one machine that, unlike any\nother \\Monster{gnomish} invention, makes the entire mountain run like\nclockwork. In the face of this, \\NPC{Commander Halion Khargos} of the \\Group{Knights of Tahkisis} must fulfill his Vision, sent to him by the \\God{Dark Queen Tahkisis}. He must take \\Place{Mt. Nevermind}. Fergus Ryan tells the amazing story of the \\Monster{gnomes} of Place{Mt. Nevermind} during the upheaval of the \\Event{Chaos War}.
