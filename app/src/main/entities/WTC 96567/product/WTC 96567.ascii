  description: "From underground caverns to rolling canyons to mountain crags, bold\n                    adventurers emerge from among the hardiest people---folk who possess an\n                    affinity with the earth itself. Drawing strength and security from their\n                    surroundings, along with the skills needed to survive, the champions of these\n                    races of stone have etched their names in legend.\n                    This supplement for the D&D game provides detailed information on the\n                    psychology, society, culture, behavior, religion, folklore, and other aspects\n                    of the races of stone: \\Monster{dwarves}, \\Monster{gnomes}, and\n                    \\Monster{goliaths}---a new race presented here. In addition to new subraces\n                    and monster races playable as characters, \\Product{Races of Stone} also\n                    provides new prestige classes, feats, spells, magic items, equipment,\n                    monsters, and rules for magic rune circles.\n                    To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the \\Product{Player\'s\n                    Handbook}, \\Product{Dungeon Master\'s Guide}, and \\Product{Monster Manual}.\n                    A player needs only the \\Product{Player\'s Handbook}."
