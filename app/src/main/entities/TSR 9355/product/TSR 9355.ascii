  description: "Beware the darkness, for it is alive with the dead! Now, the nights of\n                    \\Place{Ravenloft} are more horrifying than ever. You\'ll find out why in the\n                    pages within.\n                    Follow \\NPC{Dr. Rudolph Van Richten}, \\Place{Ravenloft}\'s leading authority\n                    on the supernatural, as he reveals how to hunt the ghosts that lurk in the\n                    blackest shadows of midnight. For countless years, \\NPC{Van Richten} has\n                    traveled the misty roads of \\Place{Ravenloft} on a mission to destroy the\n                    undead wherever they might be.

In\n                    addition, he offers his wise counsel on the ways in which these fiends can be\n                    stalked, confronted, and destroyed.\n                    Be careful, for these ghosts are not simple, moaning spirits of darkest\n                    night.
