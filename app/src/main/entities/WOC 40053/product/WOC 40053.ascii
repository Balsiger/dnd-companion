  description: "Make your dungeons come to life with this new line of miniatures for the\n                    king of the RPGs. No Dungeons & Dragons game could be complete without\n                    great-looking miniatures to represent heroes, villains, and monsters in your\n                    campaign.\n                    Hand-cast in lead-free pewter for superior quality and outstanding\n                    detail. Some miniatures are cast in multiple pieces to produce the most\n                    dynamic pose possible.\n                    Unsheathe your sword and kick down the door---it\'s time to play D&D!"
