  description: "\\larger{Who killed \\NPC{Darlington Blade}} In a country where impersonating a mage is punishable by death, \\NPC{Pryce Covington} has a \\emph{big} problem, unless he can somehow unravel the web of intrigue surrounding a most perplexing.... \\bold{Murder in \\Place{Halruaa}} When he borrowed a warm cloak from a cold corpse, little did charming, rapier-witted ne\'er-do-well \\NPC{Pryce Covington} suspect that he would be mistaken throught the Shining South for the legendary \\NPC{Darlington Blade}, adventurer, wizard, and interpid hero. \\NPC{Pryce} doesn\'t mind the red-carpet treatment he\'s mistakenly given, but he does mind that the penalty for impersonating a mage, even by accident, is death. He doesn\'t mind that \\NPC{Blade}\'s recently expired teacher has a statuesque and skillful daughter, but he does mind that she has the suspicious eye of a \\God{Mystran} inquisitress. No, \\NPC{Pryce Covington} doesn\'t even mind that he is getting in deeper with every person he meets, every word he speaks, and every move he makes, but he \\emph{does} mind that whoever murdered the real \\NPC{Darlington Blade} is extremely dangerous and obviously has placed him on top of his \'must kill\' list! Match wits with \\NPC{Pryce}, the bogus \\NPC{Blade}, as he sleuths his way through magic, mirth, and mayhem to solve a baffling \\Product{Murder in Halruaa}."
