He doesn\'t mind that \\NPC{Blade}\'s recently expired teacher has a\n                    statuesque and skillful daughter, but he does mind that she has the\n                    suspicious eye of a \\God{Mystran} inquisitress.\n                    No, \\NPC{Pryce Covington} doesn\'t even mind that he is getting in deeper with\n                    every person he meets, every word he speaks, and every move he makes, but he\n                    \\emph{does} mind that whoever murdered the real \\NPC{Darlington Blade} is\n                    extremely dangerous and obviously has placed him on top of his \'must kill\'\n                    list!\n                    Match wits with \\NPC{Pryce}, the bogus \\NPC{Blade}, as he sleuths his way\n                    through magic, mirth, and mayhem to solve a baffling \\Product{Murder in\n                    Halruaa}."
