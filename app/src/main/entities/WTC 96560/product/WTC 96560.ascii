  description: "This attractive new re-release of \\Product{The Gates of Thorbardin}\n  showcases a new look for the Heroes series.\n\n  Deep beneath the mountain fortress of \\Place{Skullcap}, legend has it, are\n  the remains of the dark wizard \\NPC{Fistandantilus} and the path to the gates\n  of the \\Monster{dwarven} kingdom of \\Place{Thorbardin}. Buried somewhere\n  along that perilous path is the magical \\Item{helm of Grallen}, son of\n  \\NPC{King Duncan}, tragic hero of the \\Event{Dwarfgate War}. The finder of\n  \\Item{Grallen\'s helm}, it is prophesized, will be rewarded and honored by a\n  united \\Place{Thorbardin} -- but he will also open the gates of the realm to\n  fresh horror and chaos.\n\n  In \\Place{The Gates of Thorbardin}, Dan Parkinson, author of\n  \\Place{Starsong}, continues the history of the \\Monster{dwarves} of\n  \\Place{Krynn} in the tradition of Nancy Varian Berberick\'s best-selling\n  \\Place{Dragonlance} novel, \\Product{Stormblade}."
