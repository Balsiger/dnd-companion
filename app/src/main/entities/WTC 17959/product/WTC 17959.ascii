  description: "Armed with new weapons and a newfound confidence, \\NPC{Nearra} and her\n  friends plan to confront the wizard \\NPC{Maddoc}. But before they can reach\n  \\Place{Cairngorn Keep}, a \\Monster{skeletal griffin} kidnaps \\NPC{Nearra} and\n  delivers her directly into the wizard\'s hands.\n\n  As \\NPC{Maddoc} prepares the final spell to unleash the \\Monster{Emergence},\n  \\NPC{Davyn} and the others struggle to rescue \\NPC{Nearra}. But in the\n  confines of \\NPC{Maddoc}\'s keep, appearances deceive. Friends become\n  enemies. Dark dreams become reality. And naive \\NPC{Nearra} may not be as\n  innocent as she seems.\n\n  \\Product{Return of the Sorceress} continues a new series of\n  \\Place{Dragonlance} adventures written specifically for readers ages 10 and\n  up. Sized to fit young readers, the series features a new group of young\n  companions who band together for friendship and excitement during the\n  \\Event{golden age} of the \\Place{Dragonlance} world.
