  description: "An Excerpt from \\emph{An Investigation into the Natural Systems of Organisms and Their Surroundings} by \\NPC[Elminster]{Elminster of Shadowdale} \\emph{The world is vast and varies, comprising towering mountains, dense jungles, and sprawling seas. There are regions so cold that their snow never melts, other so hot that their rain turns to steam as it touches the ground. It is this variety of environments that accounts for the variety of life. In my travels I have noted 73 distinct types of pine trees...I estimate the number of fishes at well over five thousand. The number of insect species likely exceeds the number of grains of sand on the shores of \\Place{Dragon Reach}. Every environment, no matter how hostile to humankind, is compatible with some form of life. The diversity and adaptability of organisms are staggering....} Within this box are nine booklets. Eight of them, each written by an expert in the area, describe various ecological niches on the continent of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}. Begin by reading the \\emph{Explorer\'s Manual}, which: \\list {introduces the read to the organization of the eight area-specific bookelts,} {contains the whole of the above excerpt of \\NPC{Elminster}\'s work-in-progress about Realmsian biodiversity, and} {provides color-coded encounter tables for the eight other booklet along with instructions for their use.} Would-be travelers are advised to read well the information presented by the \\NPC[Elminster]{Sage of Shadowdale} and his eight compatriots, and to memorize the Rules of the \\Monster{Rabbit}. There are only three: \\emph{A \\Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit} isn\'t always a \\Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit}. A \\Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit} doesn\'t want to be rich. A \\Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit} doesn\'t always stay put}. An explanation?\n\nYou\'ll find it in the emph{Explorer\'s Manual}. Read on, thou hearty adventurer!"
