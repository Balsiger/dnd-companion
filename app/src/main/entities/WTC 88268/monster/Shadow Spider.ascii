  description: "Shadow spiders are carnivorous ambush predators from the Plane of Shadow that prefer to hunt on the Material Plane. They possess frightening intelligence and cunning. A shadow spider is a huge, shadowy arachnid. It has a 5-foot-diameter body and stands roughly 2 1/2 feet tall.\n\nIts eight eyes are such a deep red color that they appear black.\n\nA shadow spider maintains a larder (actually a pocket in the Plane of Shadow) stacked with the desiccated corpses of its prey. The monster never carries treasure; it simply leaves its victimsâ€™ possessions on the corpses. When its larder becomes overfilled, the shadow spider abandons it and finds a new one to fill with food.\n\nShadow spiders speak Common."
