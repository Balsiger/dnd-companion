  description: "Day breaks, and the crowing of a distant \\Monster[Rooster]{rooster} wakes you from an all-too-short sleep. Another day of adventure, you think as you arise---but then you stop short. You, and all of your companions, have an elaborate blue tattoo covering most of your sword arm! And there\'s more to these marks than a drunken prank. As you try to find out the source and meaning of your new adornment, you are drawn further and further into danger and mystery. Will you become a pawn in somebody else\'s power game, or will you fight for your freedom and individuality? \\Product[TSR 9239]{Curse of the Azure Bonds} is an adventure set in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} game world for the AD&D 2nd Edition game. It is based on the best-selling novel, \\Product[TSR 8414]{Azure Bonds}, by Jeff Grubb and Kate Novak. And watch for the \\Product{Azure Bonds} computer game, coming soon from Strategic Simulations, Inc.!"
