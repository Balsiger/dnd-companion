  description: "In the southwest corner of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}, a thousand miles south of \\Place{Waterdeep} on the great Trade Way road, lie the three lands known collectively as the \\Place{Empires of the Sands}. They are harsh lands that have produced tough people---proud, fierce, and hard-working. The \\Place{Empires of the Sands} are now fully detailed for your role-playing campaign. The cultures, personalities, economies, cities, towns, and wilderness are described for an AD&D campaign of any size or level. \\Place{Amn}, land of merchants, where everything has a price; \\Place{Tethyr}, where petty tyrants vie for a vacant throne and evil grows; and \\Place{Calimshan}, a dry land where great magic is commonplace---all are waiting for you. This sourcebook includes \\emph{two} full-color maps showing the \\Place{Empires of the Sands} that link up with the maps provided in the original \\Place{Forgotten Realms} \\Product[TSR 1031]{boxed set}, and all the information you need to establish an exciting campaign."
