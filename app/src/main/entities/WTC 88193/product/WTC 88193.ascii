  description: "The port town of \\Place{Flotsam} has always been left to handle its own problems, neither asking for nor wanting help from the rest of Place{Krynn}. That is, until the young \\Class{mage} \\NPC{Ulin Majere} and his traveling companion are summoned there to identify a murder victim. They quickly discover there is more to the rough seaport than just one dead body, including cagey thieves, failing magic, the \\Group{Knights of Neraka}, and a very greedy, very deadly \\Monster{red dragon}."
