  description: "\\NPC{Diran} was once one of the most feared assassins in the land. But he has turned his back on murder, seeking the life of a wandering priest. But in a rough port town on the edge of the world, his past is about to catch up on him. When raiders hit the town, capturing \\NPC{Diran}\'s former lover, he must risk everything to save her. And he\'s running out of time---for these are not ordinary pirates bent on plunder, but minions of \\NPC{Erdas Cai}, a warlord and servant of the Blood of Vol."
