  description: "The \\Place{North}...rugged mountains and dense forests, which hide many beings hostile to \\Monster[Human]{man} (who has settled here but lightly). Many dungeons and ruins also lie hidden in the \\Place[The North]{Northern wastes}, relics of the former splendor of the \\Monster[Dwarf]{dwarven} kingdoms, now lost and abandoned, and of earlier, fallen kingdoms of \\Monster[Human]{men}. \\Place{Waterdeep}...crossroads of the world, \\Place[Waterdeep]{City of Splendors}. Here are wealth and goods from every corner of the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}, intrigue and feuds and important personages of rank and influence. From the many-spired towers of \\Place{Piergeiron\'s Palace} to the littered allyes of \'\\Place[The Docks]{the Docks}\', this book introduces you to the living, ever-changing city of \\Place{Waterdeep}, and suggests many adventures therein. Partake of the sights, the bustle, and the intrigue---rub shoulders with the powerful and famous---feast your eyes on fabled treasures. Hear tales in the taverns such as can be heard nowhere else in all the world---but keep your weapons ready and your wits sharp. Oh, and above all...enjoy your stay."
