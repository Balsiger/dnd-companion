  description: "\\large{A new age dawns...an age of terror!}\n                    \\emph{They are close. I can feel them even stronger, now. It won\'t be long\n                    before the Masters come again. I have waited for them, waited for their\n                    return. Once they extinguish the Light, the true Dawn can begin.}\n                    The \\Monster{illithids} once ruled a mighty empire that stretched across many\n                    worlds. These foul creatures enslaved or destroyed whole races in their quest\n                    for ultimate power---until a rebellion spread like fire on dry plains. The\n                    \\Monster{mind flayer} empire toppled, and the multiverse was freed from\n                    eternal servitude.\n                    Now, a hundred suns burn toward extinction, their light stolen by the\n                    \\Monster{flayers} to reinvent their past. If the PCs do not stop the new\n                    dawn, the \\Product{Dawn of the Overmind}, the \\Monster{illithids} will rule\n                    once again! Following the clues left by their benefactor, the adventurers\n                    journey over a vast world of ancient ruins. Buried deeply within these ruins\n                    lies an artifact of ancient \\Monster{illithid} manufacture. This item is all\n                    that stands between the \\Monster{illithids} and their nefarious goal:\n                    complete and utter domination.\n                    \\Product{Dawn of the Overmind} is the third adventure in a trilogy\n                    (originating with \\Product{A Darkness Gathering} and continuing in\n                    \\Product{Master of Eternal Night}). It can be played alone or linked with the\n                    other two parts of the trilogy to form an epic-length adventure. The\n                    \\Monster{illithid} trilogy support \\Product{The Illithiad}, a\n                    \\Product{Monstrous Arcana}, supplement that contains invaluable information\n                    on every facet of \\Monster{illithid} life, psychology, technology, and\n                    ability."
