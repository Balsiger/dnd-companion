  description: "The heroic conclusion to the tale of \\NPC{Sir Pirvan the Wayward}! Despite his humble beginnings, \\NPC{Sir Pirvan} has managed to ascend to the highest orders of the \\Group{knights of Solamnia}. Along the way, he has become known as the founder of an obscure group of knights whose own dubious\npasts have helped to dub them the \\Group{Wayward Knights}. On the verge of a\nwell-deserved retirement, \\NPC{Sir Pirvan} once again answers the call of duty and the only allies he can rely on now are the \\Group{Wayward Knights} he himself recruited so many years ago. Roland J. Green is the author of the \\Product{Starcruiser Shenandoah} and Product{Wandor} series and numerous \\Product{Conan} novels, and is coauthor (with Jerry Pournelle) of the \\Product{Jannisaries} series. Product{The Warriors} series details the exploits of the heroes and villains of the \\Event{War of the Lance}."
