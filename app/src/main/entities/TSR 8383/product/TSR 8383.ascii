  description: "The heroic conclusion to the tale of \\NPC{Sir Pirvan the Wayward}!\n\n  Despite his humble beginnings, \\NPC{Sir Pirvan} has managed to ascend to the\n  highest orders of the \\Group{knights of Solamnia}. Along the way, he has\n  become known as the founder of an obscure group of knights whose own dubious\n  pasts have helped to dub them the \\Group{Wayward Knights}. On the verge of a\n  well-deserved retirement, \\NPC{Sir Pirvan} once again answers the call of\n  duty and the only allies he can rely on now are the \\Group{Wayward Knights}\n  he himself recruited so many years ago.\n\n  Roland J. Green is the author of the \\Product{Starcruiser Shenandoah} and\n  \\Product{Wandor} series and numerous \\Product{Conan} novels, and is coauthor\n  (with Jerry Pournelle) of the \\Product{Jannisaries} series.\n\n  \\Product{The Warriors} series details the exploits of the heroes and villains\n  of the \\Event{War of the Lance}."
