  description: "Some heroes find weapons of legacy, while other forge them. Unlike other\n                    magic items, a weapon of legacy gains new abilities as its wielder becomes\n                    more powerful. In the hands of a true hero, a simple sword might achieve fame\n                    and power as great as that of the dark blade \\Item{Exordius}, the\n                    wizard-hating \\Item{Hammer of Witches}, or the skull-shattering\n                    \\Item{morningstar} known as \\Item{Mindsplinter}.\n                    This supplement for the D&D game describes nearly 50 items of legacy. Each\n                    item has its own character, a detailed history, special wielder requirements,\n                    unique powers, and adventure seeds. \\Product{Weapons of Legacy} provides\n                    rules and tools for players and DMs to forge new items of legacy for their\n                    characters or campaigns, along with new legacy feats, spells, a prestige\n                    class, and psionic powers for characters interested in wielding mythic\n                    weapons and other items of power.\n                    The ultimate guide to magic items -- especially weapons -- of rich heritage.\n                    \\Product{Weapons of Legacy} provides a wealth of information on magical\n                    weapons with rich histories. The book includes many pre-defined weapons,\n                    outlining their names, history, powers, stats, necessary rituals for\n                    unlocking their powers, and adventure hooks. How the weapons can gain power\n                    is discussed, as well as the feats with which they might be used. Also\n                    included are discussions of other magic items such as magic armor, rings, and\n                    staves."
