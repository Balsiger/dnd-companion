  description: "Welcome to Year Three! Drawn from our best adventures of 1995---not to mention the award winning \\Product{Dragon}, \\Product{Dungeon}, and \\Product{Polyhedron} Magazines---this annual also marks the return of many old classics and introduces some nifty new creatures. More than 100 denizens of land, sky, sea, and \\Place{Outer Planes} are ready to sneak, storm, or wheedle their way out of these pages and into the nearest adventure. These creatures, many of them from the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}, \\Place{Birthright}, \\Place{Ravenloft}, \\Place{Dark Sun}, \\Place{Al-Qadim}, and \\Place{Greyhawk} settings, are looking for new worlds to conquer. This collection features a full, combined index to the \\Product{Monstrous Manual} Tome and all three annuals."
