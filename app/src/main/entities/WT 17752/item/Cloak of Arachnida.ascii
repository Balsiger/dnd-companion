  description: "This black garment, embroidered with a weblike pattern in silk, gives the\n  wearer the ability to climb as if a spider climb spell had been placed upon\n  her. In addition, the cloak grants her immunity to entrapment by webspells or\n  webs of any sort --- she can actually move in webs at half her normal speed.\n  Once per day, the wearer of this cloak can cast web. She also gains a +2 luck\n  bonus on all Fortitude saves against poison from spiders."
