  description: "Setting for the \\Place{Icewind Dale}\'s trilogy of novels (\\Product[TSR 8411]{The Crystal Shard}, \\Product[TSR 8415]{Streams of Silver}, and the upcoming \\Product[TSR 8484]{Halfling\'s Gem}), and the H-series of adventure modules which culminated in a battle with \\God{Orcus} himself, the \\Place{Bloodstone Lands} are one of the wildest areas of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}. In this sourcebook, the author of the \\Product{Icewind Dale Trilogy} explores this frozen region. Presented for players and DMs alike are people, places, and events that shaped the \\Place{Bloodstone Lands}---the political movers and shakers who carved their own brand of civilization from rocks and ice. In addition to this insider information, there are 10 new adventure scenario suggestions for all levels of play, from beginner to advanced, allowing campaigning in the \\Place{Bloodstone Lands} to continue long after exploring the mines themselves and conquering \\God{Orcus}. Prepare then to enter the barbaric kingdoms of \\Place{Vaasa} and Place{Damara}---the \\Place{Bloodstone Lands}."
