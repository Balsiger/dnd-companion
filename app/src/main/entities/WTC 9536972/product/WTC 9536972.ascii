  description: "In ages past, \\Monster{dragons} ruled supreme. Now their distant scions, the race and individuals who carry their blood, live among the great empires of the world, where they forge their own glorious legacies. You can be among them. Embrace your draconic heritage, and the spoils of the world can be yours! This supplement for the D&D game provides detailed information on the psychology, society, culture, behavior, religion, and folklore of the dragonblooded races, including \\Monster{kobolds} and \\Monster{half-dragons}. This book introduces two new player character races: the \\Monster{dragonborn} (existing characters reborn in a new draconic form to combat and destroy the spawn of \\God{Tiamat}) and the \\Monster{spellscales} (artistic, philosophical beings with a penchant for sorcery and a thirst for new experiences). It also provides new prestige classes, feats, spells, magic items, equipment, and guidelines for crafting adventures and campaigns involving dragonblooded races. A new D&D sourcebook detailing races descended from \\Monster{dragons}. \\Product{Races of the Dragon} provides D&D players and Dungeon Masters with an in-depth look at races descended from or related to \\Monster{dragons}. In addition to exploring the fan-favorite \\Monster{kobold} race, \\Product{Races of the Dragon} introduces two new races, \\Monster{dragonborn} and \\Monster{spellscales}, and provides information on \\Monster{half-dragons}. The \\Monster{dragonborn} are a transitive race, an exciting new concept that allows players to transform from their initial race into a new one. This book also includes a wealth of cultural information and new prestige classes, feats, equipment, spells, and magic items. Gwendolyn F.M.
