  description: "\\NPC{Shandril} never wanted the legendary power of spellfire. All she wanted was a taste of adventure. Unfortunately, she got both. Now she\'s on the run. The evil \\Group{Zhentarim}, the sinister \\Group{Cult of the Dragon}, renegade wizards, and the terrifying monsters known as \\Monster{beholders} want her spellfire, and they\'ll destroy the entire \\Place{Realms}---let alone one scared girl---to get it! The famous wizard \\NPC{Elminster}, the \\Group{Harpers}, and the \\Group{Knights of Myth Drannor} are just as determined that \\NPC{Shandril} be free to wield spellfire for good. Of course, if she uses it for evil, they, too, will try to destroy her... \\Product{Crown of Fire} is the ninth in an open-ended series of novels focusing on the \\Group{Harpers}, the secret organization for Good in the Place{Forgotten Realms} fantasy world."
