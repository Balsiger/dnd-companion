  description: "Someone in the misty, wooded \\Place{Moonshea Isles} needs hundreds of brand-new \\Item[Sword]{swords} taken under guard from \\Place{Sword Coast} smiths to a certain place on the \\Place[Moonshea Isles]{Isles}. The swords are needed so badly, and their safe arrival is considered so unlikely, that someone is willing to pay adventurers a lot of gold---someone fairly important. Adventurers foolish enough to take assignments to good to be true (or merely desperate for coins) will soon find themselves embroiled in a dark and mysterious struggle against evil that will take them into sacred groves, crumbling castles, and through ancient \\Item[Gate]{magical gates} to the \\Place[Halls of the High King]{halls of the High King}---and beyond. This sourcebook contains background lore on the \\Place[Moonshea Isles]{Moonsheas}, a DM\'s delight of new monsters, magic items, and spells usable in any AD&D campaign and enough adventure ideas to keep the most energetic player characters seeking their fortunes in the \\Place[Moonshea Isles]{Moonsheas} for years to come!"
