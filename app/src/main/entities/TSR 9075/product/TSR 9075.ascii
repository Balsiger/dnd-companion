  description: "Under raging stormclouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the\n                    ancient walls of castle \\Place{Ravenloft}. Count \\NPC{Strah von Zarovich}\n                    stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins\n                    dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness.\n                    Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across\n                    him. \\NPC{Strahd} turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face\n                    and hands. He has a look of power---and of madness. His once-handsome face is\n                    contorted by a tragedy darken than the night itself.\n                    Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind\'s howling increases as\n                    \\NPC{Strahd} turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond\n                    his keen eyesight, a party of adventurers has just entered his\n                    domain. \\NPC{Strahd}\'s face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan\n                    unfolds. He knew they were coming, and he knows why they came, all according\n                    to his plan. He, the master of \\Place{Ravenloft}, will attend to them.\n                    Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing\n                    through the castle\'s towers. But \\NPC{Strahd} is gone. Only the howling of\n                    the wind---or perhaps a lone wolf---fills the midnight air. The master of\n                    \\Place{Ravenloft} is having guests for dinner. And you are invited."
