  description: "Under raging stormclouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of castle \\Place{Ravenloft}. Count \\NPC{Strah von Zarovich} stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness. Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across him. \\NPC{Strahd} turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands. He has a look of power---and of madness. His once-handsome face is contorted by a tragedy darken than the night itself. Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind\'s howling increases as \\NPC{Strahd} turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond his keen eyesight, a party of adventurers has just entered his domain. \\NPC{Strahd}\'s face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan unfolds. He knew they were coming, and he knows why they came, all according to his plan. He, the master of \\Place{Ravenloft}, will attend to them. Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the castle\'s towers. But \\NPC{Strahd} is gone. Only the howling of the wind---or perhaps a lone wolf---fills the midnight air. The master of Place{Ravenloft} is having guests for dinner. And you are invited."
