  description: "He left behind everything and everyone he knew --- all in the pursuit of justice. Like others of his race, \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden} was raised in the endless night of the subterranean \\Place{Underdark}. But where other \\Monster{dark elves} seek power, \\NPC{Drizzt} seeks justice. Those whom they\'d oppress, \\NPC{Drizzt} wishes to befriend. Unwilling to submit to the\nviolence and wickedness of his people, the young warrior abandoned his\nchildhood home. Journey to a new world. Realizing he\'d never truly be beyond the reach of his people as long as he remained underground, \\NPC{Drizzt} determined to do what o other of his kind had done: leave the shadows of the \\Place{Underdark} for the blazing sun of the surface. An outcast in search of a home. Now, he has begun a sojourn through a world utterly unlike his own. But acceptance among the surface-dwellers will not come easily --- nor without sacrifice..."
