By ancient law, the crown\n                    will pass to the relative \'chosen by the cup\', a family relic, in a ceremony\n                    whereby the rightful heir is selected and pretenders and other rejected\n                    candidates meet their deaths.\n                    \\Place{Pinch}\'s outlaw days have prepared him for life on the mean\n                    streets...but is he ready for the dangers that lurk in courtly hallways,\n                    among royal relatives and dagger-bearing shadows?"
