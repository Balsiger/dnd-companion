  description: "The Unapproachable East. Legendary region of unrivaled magic and profound mystery, the lands on the border of the \\Place{Endless Waste} have tantalized and captivated adventurers in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} since word of their existence reached the west. Few have returned from travels in those lands, and those who did reveal tales too peculiar for truth---or so it was thought until now. Here at last are the secrets of three of the most mysterious---and dangerous---nations in all \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n}: \\Place{Thay}, land of the treacherous \\Group{Red Wizards}; \\Place{Aglarond}, home to the unimaginably powerful \\NPC[The Simbul]{Simbul}; and \\Place{Rashemen}, realm of enigmatic Witches and wild berserkers. Adventurers beware: The treasures and excitement of the Unapproachable East invite the couragoues, yet strangers are never welcomed! The Spellbound Campaign Expansion boxed set contains: \\list {A 128-page \\emph{Campaign Guide} to the three countries, including city maps and unique sites, new character kits, spells, magical items, and major NPCs.} {Two 32-page adventures that immerse the PCs in the often-deadly power politics of the region. In \\emph{Throne of Deceit} the characters must defend \\Place{Rashemen} from a deadly invasion by \\Place[Thay]{Thayan} wizardry. \\emph{The Runes of Chaos} sends adventurers into the heart of \\Place{Thay} itself to foil the mad schemes of the would-be \\Place[Thay]{Thayan} conqueror \\NPC{Szass Tam}.} {A 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet featuring twisted \\Place[Thay]{Thayan} creations, the unpredictable nature spirits of \\Place{Rashemen}, and faerie creatures from the depths of \\Place{Aglarond}\'s magical \\Place{Yuirwood}.} {Eight full-sized card sheets providing adventure hooks and encounter charts for three realms, useful DM information, and player aids for the adventures.} {Three full-color maps---two of the region, displaying greater detail than ever seen before, and one of \\Place{Eltabbar}, the capital city of \\Place{Thay}}"
