  description: "The jingle of gold and the chance to earn glory in the battlefield motivate\n                    many people to answer a call to arms. These men and women are mercenaries,\n                    willing to fight someone else\'s battle for the chance to earn a few coins or\n                    lasting fame. \\Product[TSR 9373]{Gold & Glory} describes the mercenary\n                    companies of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} Campaign Setting. The famous and\n                    the infamous are detailed within: the \\Group{Flaming Fist}, possibly the most\n                    powerful private army on \\Place{Toril}; \\Group{The Mindulgulph Mercenary\n                    Company}, certainly the most bizarre; the honorable \\Group{Bushido}, the sly\n                    \\Group{Masquerade}, the snobbish \\Group{Order of the Blue Boar}, the\n                    hard-fighting \\Group{She-Wolves}, and many more. Many of the companies are\n                    brought to life in the 16 full-page full color portraits in this\n                    sourcebook. Gaming information, including statistics for \\Product[TSR\n                    1019]{Battlesystem} Game scenarios, is offered as well. Player characters can\n                    adventure with these mercenary corps, earning gold and glory for\n                    themselves!"
