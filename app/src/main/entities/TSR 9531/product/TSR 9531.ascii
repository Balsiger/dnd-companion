  description: "The kingdom of \\Place{Cormyr} is a land of law and order, a country populated by citizens who live good lives and treat their neighbors well. If you think these characteristics make \\Place{Cormyr} an unexciting and uninviting place...think again. Despite the ever-present \\Group[Purple Dragons]{Purple Dragon} soldiers and \\Group{War Wizards} who are charged with keeping the kingdom safe from treachery and gree, \\Place{Cormyr} is a place where evil lurks in countless nooks and crannies, where opportunities for heroic adventurers to do good for themselves and for all of \\Place{Cormyr} are as abundant as the dents on a \\Monster[Dwarf]{dwarf}\'s helmet. \\Product[TSR 9531]{Four from Cormyr} is a quartet of adventures that can be player individually or as a series. By the time they have experienced all that lies within this 128-page book, ranging from a grand soiree at the home of a noble to a chilling expedition into the \\Place{Vast Swamp}, player characters will know more about this challenging land than they ever thought they would need to know---and even if they succeed in countering all the threats they will face, they\'ll find that the conclusion to each adventure opens a new vista of possibilities for continuing danger and intrigue. Suitable for six to eight characters of levels 9--12."
