  description: "\\large{A New Realm of Horror Adventures} \\emph{In the dead of the night, as mists cloak the land, a traveler walks a country road. Footsteps echo behind him, in pace with his beating heart. Is it Death who follows? The man turns, and so turns the phantom. A flash of fang, a bloodcurdling howl, red eyes fueled by a passion from beyond the grave. The traveler discovers what others have learned before him: all roads lead to \\Place{Ravenloft}.} \\Place{Ravenloft} is a new realm of terror for AD&D adventures, rooted in the Gothic tradition. It is a \\Place{demiplane of dread and desire}, a world whose misty fingers can reach into any other campaign setting and draw unsuspecting heroes into its midst. Once it holds them in its icy embrace, it may never let them go... \\bold{What lurks beneath the covers of this box?} \\list {A 144-page book detailing a complete, terrifying new campaign world, which was inspired by the classic TSR adventure \\Product{Ravenloft}.
