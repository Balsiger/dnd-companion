  description: "\\large{\\Place{Maztica}!} In a corner of the world far removed from the known \\Place{Forgotten Realms} stands the exotic continent of \\Place{Maztica}. There \\NPC{Erix} the slave girl learns of a great destiny laid upon her by the gods themselves. At the same time, across the sea, a fateful mission of exploration embarks. The explorers, a legion of seasoned mercenaries, sail westward to discover a land of primitive savagery mixed with high culture, of brutal, bloodthirsty gods and lavish treasures. Under the banner of their vigilant god, \\God{Helm}, the legion claims these lands for their own. Only as \\NPC{Erix} sees her land invaded by these strangers, when her world itself starts to collapse around her, is her starling destiny revealed... \\Product{Ironhelm} is the first novel in \\Product{The Maztica Trilogy}, Douglas Niles\'s newest epic saga based on the \\Product{Forgotten Realms} fantasy setting."
