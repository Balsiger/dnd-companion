  description: "The followers of the many gods of \\Place{Kara-Tur} have always fought, to\n                    prove the superiority of their martial discipline and the greater wisdom of\n                    their deities. The strict hierarchy of the gods is now threatened by the\n                    sudden prominence of the followers of the \\Group{Dragon Claw}, a new and\n                    dealdy school or martial arts that threatens to destroy all other\n                    schools.
