  description: "Ages ago, giant and dragons waged war across the \\Place{Savage Frontier}. These battles are long forgotten by the \\Monster{humna} civilizations of today, but ancient relics remain. And now, the land shudders once more with the thunder of giant footsteps. Monster{Hill giants} raid farms for food and livestock, as \\Monster{stone giants} lay waste to settlements in their path. \\Monster{Frost giants} plunder coastal town, as \\Monster{fire giants} gather slaves. \\Monster{Cloud giant} castles drift across the sky, casting ominous shadows on the cities of the \\Place{North}. But no threat compares to the wrath of the \\Monster{storm giants}, who stand betrayed.\n\nPuny adventurers must rise to the challenge, gather their strength, unlock the power of ancient runes, and take the fight to the giants\'doorsteps. Only then can they discover a hidden evil formenting a war between giants and small folk. Only then can they forge an alliance to end the war before it begins."
