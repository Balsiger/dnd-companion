  description: "A \\Item{submarine} trip to an island of ghosts. A band of fugitive actors. A\n  deadly \\Monster{draconian} who has had too much holiday punch. And veritable\n  onslaught of \\Monster{dryads}, \\Monster{shadow wights}, and that rarest of\n  all monsters, the dread \\Monster{forest boojum}.\n\n  Also, from the team of Margaret Weis and Don Perrin, the latest adventure of\n  \\NPC{Kang} and his wayward troop of \\Monster{draconians}.\n\n  In the proud tradition of the best-selling \\Place{Dragonlance} anthologies,\n  \\Product{Heroes and Fools} promises a sometimes heroic -- sometimes foolish\n  -- visit to the world of \\Place{Krynn}."
