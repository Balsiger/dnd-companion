  description: "Upon command, a corrosive weapon becomes slick with a layer of acidic fluid (the wielder takes no damage from this effect). Corrosive weapons deal +1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. Bows, crossbows and slings with this ability bestow the acid energy upon their ammunition."
