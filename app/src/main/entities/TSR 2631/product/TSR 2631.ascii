Once they were\n                    gods. Now they\'re little more than debris, petrified husks of fading belief\n                    and forgotten prayer. Yet for many, their memories linger, their dreams live\n                    on---and for some, those dreams are terrifying nightmares of vengeance, and\n                    conquest, and death.}\n                    \\Product{Dead Gods} is a 176-page adventure book featuring two scenarios that\n                    can be played separately or linked together. In the first, the heroes are\n                    drawn into an epic quest to uncover the secrets behind the return of an\n                    infamous AD&D villain long thought dead.
