  description: "\\bold{Do you know what happens when the divine spark is stolen from a god?}\n\nI am the linchpin, the core. My vassals may scheme --- that is their very nature, so they must. They may try to pull themselves up into my throne, but I have been ready for that since the beginning of time.\n\n\\bold{The god is killed. Destroyed.}\n\nThey pull and their plans, theyr greed, their ambition break with their weight and fall upon them, so that the one beneath my climb upon their failure to a seat of triumph. Everything is carefully balanced, carefully ordered.\n\n\\bold{Do you know what happens when the king is stolen out of the \\Place{Nine Hells}?}\n\nIf you were to steal the divine spark from me, I would die and all that order would be lost. All that greed and ambition and carefully leashed wickedness would burst out --- the \\Place{Hells} could not contain it, oh no --- and so you would damn your entire world by doing what  you thought was good and right."
