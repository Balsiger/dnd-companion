  description: "This anthology showcases 20 years of storytelling in the \\Place{Dragonlance}\n  world by gathering into a single volume the most popular stories written by\n  the New York Times best-selling authors Margaret Weis and Tracy\n  Hickman. Their tales have defined the entire \\Place{Dragonlance} saga from\n  inception to the present day, from the \\Product{Chronicles} to the\n  \\Product{War of Souls} and beyond. Drawn from various \\Place{Dragonlance}\n  anthologies published over the last two decades, each classic story now\n  features an introduction from a \\Place{Dragonlance} author. Each introduction\n  is different and shares that author\'s perspective on the past 20 years of\n  \\Place{Dragonlance} tales."
