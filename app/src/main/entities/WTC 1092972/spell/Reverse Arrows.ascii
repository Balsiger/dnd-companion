  description: "\\emph{As you clasp the shell in one hand and the ball of sap in the other, a silver radiance flecked with blue lines surrounds you. You pocket the items, but the radiance remains.}\n\nThis spell functions like \\Spell{protection from arrows} (PH 266), except as noted here. If any projectile fired from a ranged weapon that strikes you has all its damage negated by your damage reduction (10/magic), the projectile is turned back upon the creature that fired it. The attackerâ€™s attack roll is used to determine if the reversed projectile strikes the attacker, but the damage is rerolled. If the attacker is also protected by a reverse arrows spell, it is possible for the projectile to bounce between both individuals until one of the spells is discharged from accumulated damage.\n\nOnce this spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged."
