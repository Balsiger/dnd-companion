  description: "\\emph{A faint gray shimmering force in the general shape of a staff or spear springs from your hand.}\n\nWhen you cast this spell, you create a deadly lance of force. You can freely make a thunderlance retract or grow to any length from 1 foot to 20 feet, but it always remains a straight lance of force. This effect gives you a natural reach of 20 feet. You can use a thunderlance to make powerful melee attacks.\n\nYou can wield a \\Spell{thunderlance} in one or two hands, dealing a base 3d6 points of damage (crit 20/Ã—3). Instead of using your Strength modifier, you use the higher of your Intelligence modifier or Charisma modifier as a bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.\n\nIf you successfully strike a target protected by any force effect of 3rd level or lower, such as a \\Spell{shield} or \\Spell{mage armor} spell, the \\Spell{thunderlance} might dispel the force effect in addition to damaging the target. Make a dispel check against the level of the caster who created the effect. If you succeed, the effect is dispelled. The \\Spell{thunderlance} remains whether you succeed or fail on this check."
