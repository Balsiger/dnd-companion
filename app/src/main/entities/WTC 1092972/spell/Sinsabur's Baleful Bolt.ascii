  description: "\\emph{A black bolt of dark energy begins at your fingertips and crackles out to the maximum range}\n\nThe bolt deals temporary Constitution damage and Strength damage to each creature within its area, each equal to 1d3 points +1 per four caster levels (maximum 1d3+3). Lost ability score points are recovered normally at the rate of 1 point per day. Constitution loss also causes a reduction in hit points by lowering the victimâ€™s Constitution modifier. (Creatures cannot be reduced to less than 1 hit point per Hit Die by Constitution loss.) This hit point loss might be fatal to a creature already injured, even if the Constitution loss alone does not kill it. Creatures without Strength scores or Constitution scores are unaffected by this spell."
