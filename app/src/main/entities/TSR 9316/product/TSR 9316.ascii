  description: "Situated where the \\Place{Fire River} flows into the \\Place{Sea of Fallen\n                    Stars}, \\Place{Ravens Bluff} is a bustling port and trade center. Residents\n                    and frequent visitors to \\Place{Ravens Bluff} often boast that the city is\n                    the brightest spot on the \\Place{Dragon Reach}, but even the proudest citizen\n                    thinks twice about taking to the streets when the Veil, a thick, cold fog,\n                    rolls in. The veil turns the city\'s vigorous docks into a gloomy den where\n                    only the brave, the stubborn, or the foolish go abroad. When the veil drops,\n                    neophyte adventurers join the \\Group{Nightwatch}, a special police force that\n                    sees to it that fearless citizens who prowl through the Veil restrict\n                    themselves to licit business. A successful tour in the \\Group{Nightwatch}\n                    means wealth and recognition (those who fail quitely join the uncounted\n                    dead). This modules is specially designed to introduce novice characters to\n                    the rigors of adventuring."
