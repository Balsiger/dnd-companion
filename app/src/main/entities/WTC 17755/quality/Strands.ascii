  description: "Most encounters with a \\Monster{roper} begin when it fires strong, sticky strands. The creature can have up to six strands at once, and they can strike up to 50 feet away (no range increment).\n\nIf a strand is severed, the roper can extrude a new one on its next turn as a free action."
