  description: "The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that form for up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim speed.\nThe vortex is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the elemental\'s size. The elemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.\nThe elemental\'s movement while in vortex form does not pro- voke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another creature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the elemental moves into or through the creature\'s space.\nCreatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the vortex (see the table below for details) and may be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the vortex or take the indicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking damage each round. An affected creature is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the vortex\'s effects varies with the elemental\'s size. The save DC is Strength-based.\nCreatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the whirlwind\ncan otherwise act normally, but must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + spell level) to cast a\nspell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a -4 penalty to Dexterity and a -2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time as will fit inside the vortex\'s volume.\nThe elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. A summoned elemental always ejects trapped creatures before returning\nto its home plane.\nIf the vortex\'s base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter equal to half the vortex\'s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet\naway have concealment, while those\nfarther away have total concealment.\nThose caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to\ncast a spell.\nAn elemental in vortex form\ncannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it."
