  description: "Once per day, a mephit can attempt to summon another mephit of the same\n  variety, much as though casting a summon monster spell, but with only a 25%\n  chance of success.  Roll d%: On a failure, no creature answers the summons\n  that day. A mephit that has just been summoned cannot use its own summon\n  ability for 1 hour. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell."
