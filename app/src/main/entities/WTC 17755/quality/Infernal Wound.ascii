  description: "The damage a horned devil deals with its tail attack causes a persistent\n  wound. An injured creature loses 2 additional hit points each round. The\n  wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing\n  hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 24 Heal check, a cure spell, or a heal\n  spell. However, a character attempting to cast a cure spell or a heal spell\n  on a creature damaged by a horned devil\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s tail must succeed on a DC 24 caster\n  level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A\n  successful Heal check automatically stops the continuing hit point loss as\n  well as restoring hit points. The check DC is Constitution-based."
