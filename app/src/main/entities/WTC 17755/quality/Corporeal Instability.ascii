  description: "A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible\n  transformation. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or become\n  a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect\n  (see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. The save DC is\n  Constitution-based.  An affected creature is unable to hold or use any\n  item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or\n  carried\342\200\232\303\204\303\256armor, backpacks, even shirts\342\200\232\303\204\303\256hamper more than help, reducing the\n  victim\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed\n  to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses\n  along the nerves, so strong that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim\n  cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to\n  distinguish friend from foe (\342\200\232\303\204\303\2544 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss\n  chance, regardless of the attack roll).  Each round the victim spends in an\n  amorphous state causes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock. If the\n  victim\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s Wisdom score falls to 0, it becomes a chaos beast.  A victim can\n  regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Charisma\n  check (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice\n  or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s normal form\n  for 1 minute. On a failure, the victim can still repeat this check each\n  round until successful.  Corporeal instability is not a disease or a curse\n  and so is hard to remove.  A shapechange or stoneskin spell does not cure an\n  afflicted creature but fixes its form for the duration of the spell. A\n  restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes the affliction (a\n  separate restoration is necessary to restore any drained points of\n  Wisdom)."
