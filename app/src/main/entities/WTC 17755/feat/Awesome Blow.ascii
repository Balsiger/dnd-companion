The attacking\n  creature can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent\n  can\342\200\232\303\204\303\264t move closer to the attacking creature than the square it started in. If\n  an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent\342\200\232\303\204\303\264s move, the opponent\n  and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent stops in\n  the space adjacent to the obstacle."
