type: GENERAL
benefit: "A flying creature with this feat can change direction quickly once each round as a free action. This feat allows it to turn up to 180 degrees regardless of its maneuverability, in addition to any other turns it is normally allowed. A creature cannot gain altitude during a round when it executes a wingover, but it can dive.  The change of direction consumes 10 feet of flying movement."
prerequisites: "Fly speed."
