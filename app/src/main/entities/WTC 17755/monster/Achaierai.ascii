encounter: "A large creature stands on four stiltlike legs. It has a birdlike body, round and plump, about the size of a small pony, balanced atop its legs. Feathers that range in color from brown to red cover its body, and its terrible claws and beak glint like burnished metal."
combat: "In close combat, an achaierai lashes out with two of its four legs and snaps with its powerful beak. An \\\\Monster{achaierai}\'s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction."
tactics: "It makes frequent use of its \\Feat{Spring Attack} feat to strike quickly and then retreat out of range before an enemy can counterattack."
character: "They are evil, clever, and predatory, with a distinct taste for torture."
