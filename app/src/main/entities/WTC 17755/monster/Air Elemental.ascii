  description: "Air elementals are among the swiftest and most agile creatures in existence. They seldom leave their home plane except when summoned elsewhere by a spell.\nAir elementals speak Auran, though they rarely choose to do so. The voice of an air elemental sounds like the high-pitched screech of a tornado or the low moan of a midnight storm."

encounter: "This creature appears to be an amorphous, shifting cloud surrounded by fast-moving currents of air. Darker bits of twirling vapor form the suggestion of two eyes and a mouth, but this could be a trick of the swirling air."
combat: "Their rapid speed makes air elementals useful on vast battlefields or in extended aerial combat."
