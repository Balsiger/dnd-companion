  description: "Halflings are cunning, resourceful survivors and opportunists who find room for themselves wherever they can. They might be reliable, hard-working citizens or thieves just waiting for their big chance.\n\nHalflings stand about 3 feet tall and usually weigh between 30 and 35 pounds. They have brown or black eyes. Halfling men often have long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches almost unseen. Halflings prefer simple, comfortable, and practical clothes. Unlike members of most races, they prefer actual comfort to shows of wealth. Halflings reach adulthood in their early twenties and generally live into the middle of their second century.\n\nHalflings speak Halfling and Common.\n\nMost halflings encountered outside their home are warriors; the information in the statistics block is for one of 1st level."

encounter: "This humanoid stands about half as high as a human. It has an athletic build, ruddy skin, straight black hair, and dark eyes."
character: "Halflings try to get along with everyone else. They are adept at fitting into communities of humans, dwarves, elves, or gnomes and making themselves valuable and welcome. Since human society changes more frequently than the societies of the longer-lived races, it most frequently offers opportunities to exploit, and halflings are often found in or around human lands.\n\nHalflings often form tight-knit communities in human or dwarven cities. While they work readily with others, they often make friends only among themselves. Halflings also settle into secluded places where they set up self-reliant villages.\n\nHalfling communities are known to pick up and move en masse to a place that offers some new opportunity, such as where a new mine has opened up or to a land where a devastating war has made skilled worker shard to find. If these opportunities are temporary, a community may pick up and move again once the opportunity is gone, or once a better one presents itself. If the opportunity is lasting, the halflings settle and form a new village. Some communities, on the other hand, take to traveling as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place, with no permanent home.\n\nThe chief halfling deity is Yondalla, the Blessed One, protector of the halflings. Yondalla promises blessings and protection to those who heed her guidance, defend their clans, and cherish their families."
