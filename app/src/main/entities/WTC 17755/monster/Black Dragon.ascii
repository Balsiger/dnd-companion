  description: "Black dragons are evil-tempered, cunning, and malevolent, characteristics that are reflected in their crafty, sinister faces.\n\nBlack dragon are sometimes known as skull dragons because of their skeletal faces. Adding to the skeletal impression is the gradual deterioration of the hide around the base of the horn and the cheekbones. This deterioration increases with age and does not harm the dragon. On hatching, a black dragon's scales are thin, small, and glossy. As the dragon ages, they become larger, thicker, and duller, helping it camouflage itself in swamps and marshes.\n\nBlack dragons lair in large, damp caves and multi chambered underground caverns. They smell of rotting vegetation and foul water, with an acidic undertone. Older dragons hide the entrance to their lairs using plant growth. Black dragons dine primarily on fish, mollusks, and other aquatic creatures. They also hunt for red meat but like to 'pickle' it by letting it lie in ponds within the lair for days before eating it.\n\nBlack dragons are especially fond of coins. Older dragons sometimes capture and question humanoids about stockpiles of gold, silver, and platinum coins before killing them."

encounter: "The dragon's head looks decidedly like a skull thanks to its deep-socketed eyes and wide, flat nasal opening. It has forward-curving horns and a spinal crest that peaks just behind the head and tapers off about three quarters of the way down the neck. An acidic smell surrounds the dragon, whose scales are mostly dull ebony and dark gray"
combat: "Black dragons prefer to ambush their targets, using their surroundings as cover. When fighting in heavily forested swamps and marshes, they try to stay in the water or on the ground; trees and leafy canopies limit their aerial maneuverability. When outmatched, a black dragon attempts to fly out of sight, so as not to leave tracks, and hide in a deep pond or bog."
