  description: "Half-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken for \\Monster[elf]{elves}. They may be outcasts from their parents' societies or welcomed into the elven or human community, depending on the attitudes the two groups have for each other. half-elves usually inherit a good blend of their parents' physical characteristics, so a half-aquatic elf has greenish skin, a half-drow has dusky skin and light hair, and so on."
  short_description: "A mixture between human and elf."
  incomplete: "any bonus language (except secret, like druidic); elven blood, treated as elf for most purposes considering magic"
