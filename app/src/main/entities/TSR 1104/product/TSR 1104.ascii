  description: "\\emph{\'Looking for adventure, are ye? Looking for a place brimming with silver and gold, a place dripping with things magical?\'} I know a place far and not far from here where all of that---and more---can be had. But mind me lads and lassies, there are other things there as well---danger and risk and uncertainty, and creatures never before seen by the likes of sell-swords and wizards who tread upon the sun-lit lands of the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}. \'This place is called \\Place{Undermountain}. And it is far beneath the crust of this world, yet right under fair \\Place{Waterdeep}. It is a dangerous labyrinth nestled deep in the bowels of the earth. It is a dungeon, I, \\NPC[Elminster]{Elminster of Shadowdale}, know well. I shall tell you of these twisting corridors, and of a man who made them his. Liste ye carefully---especially if ye are intent on delving into its depths. Perhaps what I tell you could save your life. \'Perhaps\'. This sequel to \\Product[TSR 1060]{The Ruins of Undermountain} contains the 128-page Campaign Guide to \\Place{Undermountain}: The Deep Level, a 32-page adventure booklet, a 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet, four full-color, poster-size maps of the levels described in this boxed set, and a set of eight DM Assistance Cards to aid in trapping the corridors and rooms of this, the greatest and most dangerous dungeon in all the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}. The original campaign expansion set wasn\'t enough? Well, then, pack your gear and delve into \\Product[TSR 1104]{Ruins of Undermountain II: The Deep Levels}. The deep-dwellers await!"
