  description: "Throughout the time of \\Place{Krynn}, one race has remained strong in its\n  pride and beliefs. The \\Monster{minotaurs} envision themselves as the\n  children of destiny, the future masters of the world. Despite adversity,\n  defeat, and enslavement, that belief has never wavered.\n\n  If there is a foe capable of destroying the \\Monster{minotaurs}, it is their\n  own arrogance. Here is told the tale of clan against clan, and of how the\n  exiled champion \\NPC{Kaz} must discover the terrible secret of the empire\n  before he and his entire race suffer the disastrous consequences.\n\n  \\bold{Land of the \\Monster{Minotaurs}}\n\n  The \\Product{Lost Histories Series} probes the historical roots and epic\n  struggles of the heretofore little-known peoples of \\Place{Krynn}. Author\n  Richard A. Knaak explores the land and history of the horned race of\n  \\Monster{minotaurs}."
