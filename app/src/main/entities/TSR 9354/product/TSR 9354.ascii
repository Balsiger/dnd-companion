  description: "Welcome to the picturesque village of \\Place{Eveningstar}, nestled at the\n                    foot of the \\Place{Stonelands} where the \\Place{River Starwater} winds down a\n                    gorge and snakes into the \\Place{King\'s Forest}.\n                    Here, the \\Group{Knights of Myth Drannor} began their famous\n                    adventures. Here, the \\Group{Ladies of the Brazen Blade}, \\Group{The Company\n                    of the Sining Sword}, \\Group{The Steel Shield Band}, and many others came,\n                    clutching royal charters from \\NPC[King Azoun IV]{King Azoun} with the ink\n                    scarcely dry on the parchment. Some fell, some went on to greatness---but\n                    they all come here first: here, to the \\Place{Haunted Halls}.\n                    Despite numerous infiltrations, the \\Place[Haunted Halls]{Halls} have not yet\n                    yielded all their secrets and treasures. Many dangers lurk as deadly as ever\n                    in dark chambers herein, awaiting new companies of eager-eye adventurers.\n                    Is it your turn to dare \\Place[Haunted Halls]{The Haunted\n                    Halls}? Many come, but few survive to again see \\Place{Eveningstar}\'s beauty.\n                    Welcome, then. Enter in, and find in these pages:\n                    \\list\n                    {A challenging introductory-level dungeon.}\n                    {A detailed countryside setting, including important local personages,\n                    local color, and guidelines for play.}\n                    {Suggested campaign plots and adventures.}\n                    {New spells.}\n                    {New magical items.}\n                    {New monsters.}\n                    A splendid campaign can begin here. Adventurers in an ongoing campaign can\n                    stop by for a memorable visit. Those looking for an underground stronghold\n                    may even find a home in the \\Place[Haunted Halls]{Haunted Halls of\n                    Eveningstar}."
