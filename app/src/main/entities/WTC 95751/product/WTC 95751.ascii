  description: "The \\Monster{black dragon}, a temperamental tyrant, rules the swamp. Nearby villages pay it tribute---or else. It breathes a deadly stream of acid that dissolves meta, stone, flesh, or bone with terrible ease.\n\nDrawn from the pages of the Dungeons & Dragons \\Product{Monster Manual} and \\Product{Dragonomicon}, the Gargantuan \\Monster{Black Dragon} makes a bold and dramatic statement as it erupts from its fetid swamp to wreck havoc on unwary adventurers or battle-hardened warbands."
