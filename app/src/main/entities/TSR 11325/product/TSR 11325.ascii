  description: "\\large{\'Evil is seeping from the earth!\'}\n                    \\right{---Old Two Fingers}\n                    From time out of mind, the standing stones known as the \\Place{Circle of\n                    Cahervaniel} have stood lonely vigil on a grassy hilltop. Sheepherders once\n                    moved their flocks over the hill and through the circle, sometimes resting in\n                    the cool shadows cast by the ancient stones.\n                    Everything changed when a stone finger fell, revealing a fissure in the\n                    earth. Now, dark shadows caress the circle after the sun sets. Creatures out\n                    of nightmare dance upon the hillsides at night. Many swear that a\n                    \\Monster{unicorn} of deepest ebony now hunts all upon two legs who draw near,\n                    while stunted creatures scurry in the shadows, abducting sheep from their\n                    sheds and drawing them down below ground for food.\n                    After the disappearance of a shepherd, fear grows stronger in neighboring\n                    villages. Who will brave the black hollow of the ancient \\Place{Circle of\n                    Cahervaniel}? Heroes of stern mettle must descend into the cavity and explore\n                    the ancient spaces existing there.\n                    \\Product{The Shattered Circle} is a stand-alone adventure in which low-level\n                    characters explore an ancient dungeon long hidden below ground. Accomplished\n                    players with new characters will find this adventure fun and challenging, but\n                    it can also serve as a beginner\'s first taste of the AD&D game.\n                    \\bold{For four to six characters of levels 1--3}"
