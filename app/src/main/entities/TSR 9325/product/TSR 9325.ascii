  description: "Few creatures inhabiting the realms of \\Place{Greyspace},\n  \\Place{Krynnspace}, and \\Place{Realmspace} know (or even dream) of each\n  others\' existence. Fewer still understand the celestial bonds they secretly\n  share.\n\n  As the worlds of \\Monster{men} and \\Monster{elves}, \\Monster{dwarves} and\n  \\Monster{dragons} are about to discover, no less than \\bold{twelve} unknown\n  spheres stand poised for war...a war as unexpected as it will be\n  devastating!\n\n  Twelve spheres against three---hardly fair ods. But then again, \\NPC{Emperor\n  Vulkaran the Dark}, \\NPC{Master of the Twelve Spheres} and \\NPC{Ruler of All\n  Known Space}, doesn\'t like a fair fight. He\'s never fought one yet!\n\n  \\Product{Under the Dark Fist}, a 64-page adventure for the\n  \\Product{Spelljammer setting}, provides enough material to wage an\n  intergalactic war across 15 sphere! It can be used as an epic stand-alone\n  adventure or easily incorporated into an existing campaign. This challenging\n  adventure is recommended for experienced players and referees.\n\n  This adventure is designed for a party of four to eight characters, levels 10\n  to 14."
