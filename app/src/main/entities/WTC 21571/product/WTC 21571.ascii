  description: "Cold, forbidding, remote, it stands like a dim white cloud on the very edge\n  of sight. There \\NPC{Kerrick}, an \\Monster{elf} from the \\Place{golden woods\n  of Silvanesti}, has been sent, an exile in disgrace. There too, a band of\n  barbarian villagers make their stand against the remnants of an\n  \\Monster{ogre} empire that is determined to once again rule the frozen\n  wastes.\n\n  In the first book of this thrilling trilogy, Douglas Niles takes his readers\n  to a land that most in \\Place{Krynn} have heard of only in legend -- the\n  legend of the \\Place{Icewall}."
