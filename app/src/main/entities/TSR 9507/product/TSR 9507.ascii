  description: "\\large{The secrets of the \\Place{spirit world} unveiled for the first time!} There is a world unseen by mortals, a world filled with invisible beings that whisper words unheard by all---all but the shaman. The shaman alone knows how to listen for the \\Monster{spirits}, and the shaman alone knows their secrets. This 96-page AD&D game accessory introduces three new priest classes with unique powers and exciting potential. More subtle and versatile than clerics and wizards, the shamans tap the energies of the mysterious \\Place{spirit world}, using their extraordinary abilities to further their personal goals, as well as the agendas of their unseen \\Monster{spirit} patrons. \\Product{Shaman} offers complete information on the new classes, tips for incorporating then into established campaigns, new skills, new spells, and a detailed look at the unseen world of \\Monster{spirits}."
