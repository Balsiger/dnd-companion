  description: "Druids love forests, true---but they love the arctic tundra, tropical rain forests, broad savannas, and fungi caverns of the \\Place{Underdark}, too. This 128-page accessory expands the living world of the druid in the AD&D 2nd Edition game, bringing new homes, character kits, personalities, spells, magical items, herbal lore, and a hundred details on druidic society, sacred groves, and high-level aspirations. This book has it all---don\'t leave the woods without it!"
