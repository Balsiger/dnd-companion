  description: "I am \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden}, hardened by the whips of the \\Monster{drow} matrons and softened by the honest love of friends. The \\Group{Companions of the Hall} are no more, and at long last I have a sense of finality. My journey takes me from \\Place{Gountlgrym}, as it once took me from \\Place{Mithral Hall}, but I doubt I shall return. It is time to let go of that which is past and seek new roads.\n\nI am \\NPC{Sylora Salm}, sworn enemy of \\NPC{Dahlia Sin\'felle} and loyal disciple of the archi-lich \\NPC{Szass Tam}. I will feed the \\Item{Dread Ring} with the souls of \\Place{Neverwinter}, and no one can stop me. Not even \\NPC{Dahlia} and her newfound ally, the drow.\n\nI am \\Place{Neverwinter}, a city once known as the \\Place{Jewel of the North}, burnt to ashes and fighting to survive. As \\NPC{Herzgo Alegni} vies for control of my people and \\NPC{Sylora Salm} plots to bring about a cataclysm that will destroy me once and for all, I struggle to stand strong. After centuries of life behind my once-glorious walls, can this truly be my end?"
