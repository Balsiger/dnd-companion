For the unprepared adventurer, the \\Place{Feywild} perilous: cruel \\Monster{giants}, fierce beasts, and devious \\Monster{faries} dwell there. For others, the \\Place{Feywild} is a land of opportunity, with vast tracts of unexplared wilderness filled with ancient ruins and lost treasures. If you\'re going to survive long, you\'ll need to embrace your wild side and channel the magic and primal power of the \\Place{Feywild}.\n\n\\Product{Player\'s Option: Heroes of the Feywild} presents races, classes, character themes, feats, powers, and other character options that have a strong connection to the \\Place{Feywild}. It also gives players and Dungeon Masters background information on the inhabitants of this weird and wondrous plane, and how adventurers might cross paths with them.\n"
