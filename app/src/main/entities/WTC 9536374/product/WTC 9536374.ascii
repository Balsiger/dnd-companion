  description: "The \\Item{Golden Dragon}, conceived as a skyfaring warship, now serves as a symbol of peace among the \\Place{Five Nations}. Even before the luxurious airship embarks on its maiden voyage, nefarious pirates, thieves, and saboteurs conspire to defame, steal, or destroy it. Resourceful adventurers are needed to protect the ship and its passengers, but can they uncover the secret enemy lurking in their midst? Product{Voyage of the Golden Dragon} is a stand-alone adventure for the Dungeon & Dragons game that immerses your characters in the \\Product{Eberron campaign setting}. Designed to challenge 7th-level characters, it takes heroes on a perilous journey from \\Place{Sharn} to \\Place{Stormreach} and also serves as a launching pad for adventures the world over.\n\nThe fourth stand-alone adventure for the \\Place{Eberron} campaign setting.\n\nThis low-level stand-alone \\Place{Eberron} adventure revolves around the maiden voyage of the \\Item{Golden Dragon}, an immense elemental Item{skyship} created as a symbol of peace by the \\Place{Five Nations of Khorvaire}. On the \\Item{Golden Dragon} itself and at the locations it visits, the player characters must unravel plots of intrigue against the ship and its important passengers. Though it is not necessary to play the previous Place{Eberron} adventures before \\Product{Voyage of the Golden Dragon}, sidebars explaining how they can be linked together are included."
