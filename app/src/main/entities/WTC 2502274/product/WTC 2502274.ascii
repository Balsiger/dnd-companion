Their luck and the gods above are all that keep them safe from horrifying behemoths, bloodthirsty \\Monster{sahuagin}, nigthmarish \\Monster{kraken} patrolling their masters\' territory...\n                    ... and the otherwordly fey that sailors call the \\NPC{Blue Lady}.\n                    No one knows where she came from. No one knows what she wants. But the blue depths of the \\Place{Sea of Fallen Stars} are her prison --- one she\'s ready to escape.\n                    \\Large{The Lucky Ones Drown.}"
