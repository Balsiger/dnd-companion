He told the mysterious stranger from \\Place{Shou Lung} that he\'d help him. He told the most dangerous man in \\Place{Altumbel} that he would deliver a fortune in gems. He should have kept his mouth shut. Fourth in a series that brings to life the people who survive on the fringes and in the shadows of the Forgotten Realms world---The rogues."
