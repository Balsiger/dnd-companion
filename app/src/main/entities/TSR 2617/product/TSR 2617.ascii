  description: "Lost... Lost...\n\n  Though \\NPC{Areas} rescued his uncle from the clutches of \\Monster{fiends},\n  he lost his love, \\NPC{Nina}, to a conniving \\Monster{tiefling}...and to the\n  very pits of the \\Place{Abyss}. Now he descends to the \\Place{underworld} to\n  find her but discovers that, in the \\Place{planes}, a person can be lost in\n  more than body.\n\n  \\NPC{Nina} has gone mad. With powers she only now is discovering, she draws\n  to herself a hellish army bent on capturing a beachhead on the\n  \\Place{Beastlands}. What \\NPC{Areas} and the forces of good do not realize is\n  that this toehold provides her monstrous horde a doorway to all the\n  \\Place{planes}."
