  description: "For years beyond measure, fold of \\Place{Faer\\hat{u}n} have sailed and swum the \\Place{Inner Sea} from the \\Place{Lake of Dragons} to the \\Place{Alamber Sea}, but few believed there was more here than a vast expanse of blue water filled with fish, a few sea monsters, and ever-present pirates. Come, take another look and discover new worlds above and beneath the sea. Once you enter the \\Place{Sea of Fallen Stars}, you may never want to go home again. \\list {\\emph{Atop the Waves:} Examine life on the \\Place{Inner Sea} from the major ports and common superstitions to the goings-on in the \\Place{Pirate Isles}.} {\\emph{Beneath the Seas:} Discover the worlds within the \\Place{Inner Sea}! Visit \\Place{Ser\\hat{o}s}, an ancient land. Meet the enigmatic \\Monster[Shalarin]{shalarin}, a magical sea people from unknown oceans. Join the mysterious \\Monster[Dukar]{Dukars}, magical defenders of the depths.} {\\emph{\\Place{Myth Nantar}, \\Place[Myth Nantar]{City of Destinies}:} Wrapped in a magical mythal, the \\Monster[Elf]{elven} city of \\Place{Myth Nantar} is the perfect place to make the transition to the world under the waves or to begin a complete aquatic campaign.} \\Product[TSR 11393]{Sea of Fallen Stars} is the first fully developed underwater setting for AD&D campaign play. It provides a focus for the use of the rules supplements \\Product[TSR 2170]{Of Ships and the Sea} and \\Product[TSR 9539]{Sea Devils}, but neither of these products is needed to use this book. Contained in these pages is everything you need to adventure in this exciting world. Bring your game beneath the waves with rules and magic that make it easy and fun to do, or create \\Monster[Sea Elf]{sea elf}, \\Monster[Merman]{merman}, \\Monster[Triton]{triton}, \\Monster[Locathah]{locathah}, or \\Monster[Shalarin]{shalarin} PCs using the character-creation rules herein. Either way, get ready to explore \\Place[Netheril]{Netherese} ruins, sunken ships, and abyssal trenches in the Place{Sea of Fallen Stars}!"
