  description: "At long last, the story of the beautiful dark-hearted \\NPC{Kitiara Uth Matar}. This compelling novel tells the story of the birth of her twin\nbrothers, the \\Class{warrior} \\NPC{Caramon} and the frail \\Class{mage}\n\\NPC{Raistlin}, and \\NPC{Kit}\'s admirable role in their upbringing. But her youthful mercenary deeds and increasing fascination with evil throw her into the company of a roguish stranger and band of adventurers whose fates are intermingled with her own. Haunted by the memory of her Place{Solamnic} father, she hunts him ceaselessly. Tina Daniell\'s first novel brings to life this remarkable Class{warrior}-woman, whose credo of \'the sword is truth\' becomes her triumph and downfall."
