  description: "\\large{The Assasin} A cold and emotionless killer for whom every soul has a price, even his own, embarks on a path to find out just how high that price can be. \\large{The Mercenary} A \\Monster[drow]{dark elf} of limitless guile dares to challenge a king, and carve for himself a place in the inhospitable \\Place{World Above}. PC{Ilnezhara} and \\NPC{Tazmikella} are ancient \\Monster[dragon]{dragons} of great power, accustomed to easily manipulating the \\Monster[Human]{humans} around them, but not all \\Monster[Human]{humans} are so easily led. When they pushed \\NPC{Entreri} and \\NPC{Jarlaxle} into the heart of the \\Place{Bloodstone Lands}, not even they could have imagined the strength of the \\Monster{human} assassin\'s resolve, or the limitless expanse of the \\Monster{drow} mercenary\'s ambition."
