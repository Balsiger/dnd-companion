  description: "A war brews on a continent that has withstood more than its fair share of conflict. The \\Place{Dwendalian Empire} and the \\Place{Kryn Dynasty} are carving up the lands around them, and only the greatest heroes would dare stand between them. Somewhere in the far corners of this war-torn landscape are secrets that could end this conflict and usher in a new age of peace --- or burn the world to a cinder.\\par Create a band of heroes and embark on a journey across the continent of \\Place{Wildemount}, the setting for season 2 of the hit series Critical Role. Within this book, you'll find new character options, a heroic chronicle to help you craft your character's backstory, four different starting adventures, and everything a Dungeon Master needs to breathe life into a \\Place{Wildemount}-base campaign."
