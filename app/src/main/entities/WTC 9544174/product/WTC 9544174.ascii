  description: "\\NPC{Vell} was content to be a mere warrior in the \\Group{Thunderbeast}\n                    tribe, staying behind on the hunt to guard the camp.\n                    But then something alien awakened deep within him, the spirit of a behemoth\n                    that he could not control. With it came attacks from the sky, visitors from\n                    far lands, and a mysterious command from their ancestral totem: Find the\n                    living. And this time, no one was going to let him just stay behind."
