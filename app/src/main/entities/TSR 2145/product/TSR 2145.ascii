  description: "They\'re ba-ack! Virtually all of the monsters that appeared in TSR\'s 1993 AD&D product line, plus many of those that appeared in the \'93 issues of \\Product{Dragon}, \\Product{Dungeon}, and \\Product{Polyhedron} Magazines, are brought together in this first release in an annual series of Monstrous Compendium supplements. This book is crawling with more than 100 denizens of the land, sky, sea, and underdark, waiting to creep into the nearest adventure. Creatures within these pages have appeared in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign setting, the \\Place{Al-Qadim} world of adventure, the \\Place{Ravenloft} world of horror, the \\Place{Dark Sun} game world, and even the \\Place{Outer} and \\Place{Inner Planes}, but they\'ve all been reorganized, updated, and edited so they can be used in any campaign. An introduction explaining how to breathe life into random encounters is included too. Every illustration is brand new and presented in full color, so these monsters are more lifelike then ever before! This is a must-have item for all serious Dungeon Masters."
