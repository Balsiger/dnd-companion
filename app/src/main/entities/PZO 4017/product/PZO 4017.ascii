  description: "Wan sunlight filters in through a canopy thick with hanging moss. Twisted\n  roots turn the narrow, winding path into a treacherous obstacle, and gnarled\n  branches seem to reach down to pluck and scratch at unwary travelers. These\n  dense tangles that can hide any number of monsters and menaces, and now they\n  come to life in the latest of Paizo Publishing\'s GameMastery Map Packs!\n\n  This line of gaming accessories provides simple and elegant tools for the\n  busy Game Master. Inside, you\'ll find 18 beautiful 5\'\'x8\'\' map tiles that can\n  be combined to form a wide range of sites explorers might come across in any\n  large, vast woodland.\n\n  \\list\n  {These cards present several different forest elements, including: Blighted Forest Glen}\n  {Briar Patch}\n  {Druid Glade}\n  {Fairy Ring}\n  {Overgrown Ruins}\n  {Winding Pathways}\n\n  Game Masters shouldn\'t waste their time drawing trees and mazes of tangled\n  undergrowth every time the player characters wander into the woods.
