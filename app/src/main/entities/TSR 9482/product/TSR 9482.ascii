  description: "\\large{Get out of town and into the world!} \\Product{Country Sites}, the third in a series of AD&D game accessories, is a companion of challenging and distinctive settings that will test the mettle of any group of player characters. Herein is all the information a Dungeon Master needs to build adventures within these settings and incorporate them into an existing campaign: background information, maps, location descriptions, and summary profiles of the unusual characters who populate these strange places. Take your character into the \'\\Place{City of the Dead}\'. See if they can overcome the obstacles of \'\\Place{Darians Wall}\', or arrange for them to pay a visit to \'\\Place{The Place of Broken Dreams}\'. Every one of the 11 \\Product{Country Sites} in this 96-page book will open new vistas for adventuring in (and sometimes under) the great outdoors. Previous books in this series include \\Product{City Sites} and \\Product{Castle Sites}. Suitable for all levels of play."
