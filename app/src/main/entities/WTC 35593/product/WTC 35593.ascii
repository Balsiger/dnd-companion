  description: "\\Place{Gardmore Abbey}. Once the bastion of a \\Class{paladin} order devoted to \\God{Bahamut}, this sacred monastery has become a monster-infested ruin. According to legend, the \\Class{paladins} brought back an artifact from a far-off campaign and stored it in the abbey for safekeeping, and evil forces assaulted the abbey in a failed bid to recapture it. What the legends don\'t reveal is that this artifact is a \\Item{Deck of Many Things}!\n\nThis Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game adventure lures heroes into the ruins of \\Place{Gardmore Abbey} --- a place warped and twisted by the chaotic forces surrounding the \\Item{Deck of Many Things}, forces that transform the location with each successive visit.\n\nThis box contains the following components: list\n{Four 32-page books describing \\Place{Gardmore Abbey} and its inhabitants, along with quests and encounters}\n{2 double-sided battle maps depicting key adventure locations}\n{2 die-cut sheets of cardstock tokens and dungeon tiles}\n{The \\Item{Deck of Many Things} (22 cards) plus 2 exclusive Treasure Cards}\n"
