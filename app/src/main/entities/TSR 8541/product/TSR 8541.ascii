  description: "A mysterious spell had fallen over the \\Class{bards} of \\Place{Waterdeep}, rewriting the past in their memories and adding dangerous new tales to their repertoires. \\NPC{Khelben Arunsun}, the archmage of \\Place{Waterdeep}, fears that this spell is part of a larger plot. He calls upon \\NPC{Danilo Thann}, a \\Group{Harper} \\Class{mage} and would-be \\Class{bard}, to confront the \\Monster{green dragon} who holds the key to the mystery. To do so, \\NPC{Danilo} joins forces with an old enemy, the rogue \\Monster{elf} \\NPC{Elaith Craulnober}. Along with his new companions, a \\Monster{gold elf} minstrel with strange abilities and a \\Monster{dwarf} maid with a deadly wit, \\NPC{Danilo} is drawn into a web of riddles and magic. Bardcraft is more demanding than \\NPC{Danilo} imagined, and he must find within himself the strength to wield a new and unexpected power."
