  description: "A mysterious spell had fallen over the \\Class{bards} of \\Place{Waterdeep},\n                    rewriting the past in their memories and adding dangerous new tales to their\n                    repertoires. \\NPC{Khelben Arunsun}, the archmage of \\Place{Waterdeep}, fears\n                    that this spell is part of a larger plot. He calls upon \\NPC{Danilo Thann}, a\n                    \\Group{Harper} \\Class{mage} and would-be \\Class{bard}, to confront the\n                    \\Monster{green dragon} who holds the key to the mystery. To do so,\n                    \\NPC{Danilo} joins forces with an old enemy, the rogue \\Monster{elf}\n                    \\NPC{Elaith Craulnober}. Along with his new companions, a \\Monster{gold elf}\n                    minstrel with strange abilities and a \\Monster{dwarf} maid with a deadly wit,\n                    \\NPC{Danilo} is drawn into a web of riddles and magic. Bardcraft is more\n                    demanding than \\NPC{Danilo} imagined, and he must find within himself the\n                    strength to wield a new and unexpected power."
