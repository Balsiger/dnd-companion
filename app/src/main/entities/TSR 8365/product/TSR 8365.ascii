  description: "In a time of war, a princess of \\Place{Qualinost} and an elite band of\n  \\Class{warriors} sail forth to rescue their countrymen from the collapsing\n  \\Place{Ergoth Empire}. Their journey goes awry when a strange mist engulfs\n  \\NPC{Princess Vixa}\'s ship and transports them to a \\Place{phantom island}.\n\n  Who are the mysterious masters who imprison them in their undersea city?\n\n  No soul has encountered the fabled \\Monster{Dargonesti} or visited the\n  \\Place{city of pearl marble} that rises from the sea floor -- and lived to\n  tell the tale. \\NPC{Princess Vixa} and her companions meet the race of\n  \\Monster{sea elves}, experience a fantastical underwater world, face a foe\n  counted among the legends of \\Place{Krynn}, and accept an impossible mission\n  that will bring them back to the land they call home.\n\n  \\bold{The \\Monster{Dargonesti}}\n\n  The \\Product{Lost Histories Series} probes the historical roots and epic\n  struggles of the heretofore little-known peoples of \\Place{Krynn}."
