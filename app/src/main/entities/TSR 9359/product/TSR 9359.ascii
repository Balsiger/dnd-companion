But mysterious circumstances caused the sudden demise of the guild several years ago and resulted in the deaths of some important members. And a ghostly figure now threatens the few surviving member of the guild. \\Product{Wizards Challenge} is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for a single character or a party of up to three members.
