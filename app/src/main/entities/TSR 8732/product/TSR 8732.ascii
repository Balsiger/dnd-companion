Brooding on the death\n                    of his brother at the hands of extraplanar forces, \\NPC{Urza} drifts among\n                    the planes.\n                    But the end of the \\Event{Brother\'s War} has transformed him into something\n                    greater. Deep within his heart, a spark has been kindled to a flame that\n                    cannot be quenched.\n                    \\NPC{Urza} has become a planeswalker."
