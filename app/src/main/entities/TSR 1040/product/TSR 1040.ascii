  description: "It is called the \\Place[Waterdeep]{City of Splendors}: \\Place{Waterdeep}, most populous and powerful of the cities of the \\Place{North}. It is a city of wealth, adventure, and danger. More men have died in its taprooms and bards than in all the sieges of \\Place{Dragonspear Castle}. Success and death lurk in its shadowed entranceways and dimly-lit streets. Come explore the greatest city of the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms} in this incredible new boxed set dealing with urban fantasy adventures. \\Place{Waterdeep} is detailed in no less than 10 expanded maps, embellished with typical building interiors suitable for use in any campaign setting. In addition, a full-size poster of \\Place{Waterdeep} is provided, along with a grand-scale three-dimensional map of \\Place{Castle Waterdeep}, hub of the city\'s government. In addition to all these maps, a 32-page City System booklet provides encounters and street scenes, special features and details of \\Place{Waterdeep}, and methods for creating types of buildings in moments and filling the pockets of those unfortunate enough to get in a player character\'s way. Designed for use with \\Place{Waterdeep}, these new features are suitable for use anywhere in the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}! It\'s all here---all you add is your imagination."
