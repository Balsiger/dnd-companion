  description: "The town of \\Place{Curston} is hit with a dastardly crime spree: fires,\n  thefts, even vicious attacks. All the clues point to one suspect:\n  \\NPC{Kellach} and \\NPC{Driskoll}\'s dad, \\NPC{Torin}. But the \\Group{Knights}\n  are convinced \\NPC{Torin} has been framed. Deep in the \\Place{Dungeons of\n  Doom}, a terrifying creature holds the key to proving \\NPC{Torin}\'s\n  innocence. Can the \\Group{Knights} find the creature before \\NPC{Torin} is\n  sent to prison ... or worse?\n\n  \\Product{Sign of the Shapeshifter} continues a new series of adventures\n  written specifically for readers ages 8 and up. Sized to fit young hands, the\n  series follows the adventures of three children who, through their heroic\n  deeds, become members of the \\Group{Order of the Knights of the Silver\n  Dragon}. This opportunity will be extended to readers of the series as well\n  through the Knights of the Silver Dragon Club. Young readers are encouraged\n  to join and participate in the club, and in turn they will receive free\n  giveaways, special correspondence, and other benefits. Fans will also be\n  encouraged to interact with the club through an exclusive member area on\n  \\link{www.knightsofthesilverdragon.com}."
