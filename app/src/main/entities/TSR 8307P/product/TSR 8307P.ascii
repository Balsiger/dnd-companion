  description: "The \\Event{War of the Lance} has ended. The darkness has passed. Or has it?\n\nOne man, the powerful archmage \\NPC{Raistlin}, intends that the darkness return.\n\nTwo people alone can stop him. One is \\NPC{Crysania}, a beautiful cleric of good, who is drawn to \\NPC{Raistlin} as a moth is drawn to flame. The other is his twin, \\NPC{Caramon}, who must come to an understanding of himself before he can redeem his brother.\n\nTogether with the irrepressible \\Monster{kender}, \\NPC{Tasslehoff}, these three take a perilous journey back in time to the days just before the \\Event{Cataclysm}.\n\nIn the doomed city of \\Place{Istar}, poised on the brink of disaster, dark magic and darker ambition battle love and self-sacrifice in a quest to save not only the world but more importantly --- a soul."
