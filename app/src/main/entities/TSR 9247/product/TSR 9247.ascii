  description: "\\large{The Gods walk the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}.} Cast out from their heavenly domain, the gods of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} wander the land as mortals---extremely powerful mortals, to be certain, but mortals nonetheless. They seek the lost \\Item{Tablets of Fate}, key to their return. But as the good and evil gods of the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms} bring their fight down to earth, the people and lands are caught in between. Nature itself revolts: Strange creatures stalk the countryside, and even magic becomes unpredictable. When a band of adventurers are hired by a young apprentice to rescue her sorceress-mentor, little to they realize the size of the stakes they will soon be playing for. Caught up in a power struggle that will determine the fate of the \\Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms} themselves, the first step is to find the only mortal who may know what\'s going on---the legendary sage \\NPC{Elminster}. And that means going to \\Place{Shadowdale}. \\Product[TSR 9247]{Shadowdale} is the first of a three-part series of modules for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition roleplaying game. Set in the popular \\Place{Forgotten Realms} game world, this module features the same setting and many of the same characters of the first novel of the \\Product{Avatar Trilogy}, \\Product[TSR 9247]{Shadowdale}, by Richard Awlinson. This AD&D 2nd Edition adventure is for four to six characters of levels 5--8."
