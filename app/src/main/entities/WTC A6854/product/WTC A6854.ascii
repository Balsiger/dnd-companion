  description: "In the fifth book of the multi-author Sundering series kicked off by best-selling author R.A. Salvatore, embittered paladin, \\NPC{Keef Kenric}, finds himself embroiled in a quest to stop evil forces from taking advantage of the chaos rolling across the land of \\NPC{Faer√ªn} and claiming dominion over the entirety of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}.\n\nStubbornly, clinging to his family\'s worship of a long-forgotten god, \\NPC{Kleef} soon discovers that his god has blessed him with divine gifts, making him one of a new group of Chosen cropping up around the \\Place{Realms}. This divine git makes him an excellent ally - and a target for those who wish to corral his powers.\n\nAfter battling his way out of \\Place{Marsember}, a city besieged on all sides in the wake of the Sundering, he becomes swept up in the mission of a group of odd allies - a warrior princess, an accomplished thief, and a mysterious short pudy man exuding a fain odor of decay. With the forces of \\Group{Shade} tracking their every step, they set out to thwart the rise of the goddess of death, but before long \\NPC{Kleef} discovers that his allies hide dangerous secrets - secrets that could destroy not only \\NPC{Kleef} but the very fabric of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}."
