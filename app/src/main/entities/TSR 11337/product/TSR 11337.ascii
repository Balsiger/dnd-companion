  description: "\\emph{\\Place{Icewind Dale}, \\Place{Ten Towns}, \\NPC{Regis} the lovable \\Monster[Halfling]{halfling} scoundrel, and \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden}, \\Monster[Drow]{drow} ranger. These names are legendary in the annals of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms} \\Product[TSR 1085]{setting}, made famous in the bestselling novels by author R.A. Salvatore.} Now, Salvatore and his original gaming group, the \\Group{Seven Swords}, return to the \\Place{Savage Frontier} in this exciting 32-page adventure. The PCs begin in the port city of \\Place{Luskan}, where they\'re hired on by a caravaning merchant to perform guard duty for the long, dangerous journey over the \\Place{Spine of the World} Mountains. If the heroes do well, they reach the small town of \\Place{Targos}, where they hear rumors of a dead mage\'s lost tower out on the tundra. In order to find it, the PCs must overcome numerous obstacles but may find allies in the peoples of the \\Place{Ten-Towns} region, including a barbarian prince, a sly \\Monster[Halfling]{halfling}, and a unique ranger. Not all is as it seems, though, nor can all smiling faces be trusted. Can the PCs separate the truth from the lies, locate the \\Place{Accursed Tower}, determine all its secrets, and survive? This low-level, stand-alone adventure fits into any existing \\Place{Forgotten Realms} \\Product[TSR 1085]{campaign}. It\'s also easily adapted to any other AD&D game campaign world. For four to eight characters of levels 1--3"
