  description: "If a character studies his victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (character\'s choice). While studying the victim, the assassin can undertake other actions as long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the assassin or recognize the assassin as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + character\'s class level + the character\'s Int modifier) against the kill effect, he dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim\'s mind and body become enervated, rendering her helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the character. If the victim\'s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the character has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if the assassin does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack."
