  description: "Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a +2 light mace. Its other magi- cal powers are as follows. \n\nlist {\\bold{Thunder:} Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod\342\210\232\302\242\302\254\303\204\302\254\303\264s impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.} \n\n{\\bold{Lightning:} Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round.} \n\n{\\bold{Thunderclap:} Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shoutspell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).} \n\n{\\bold{Lightning Stroke} Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet.} \n\n\\bold{Thunder and Lightning:} Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning strokedeals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects."
