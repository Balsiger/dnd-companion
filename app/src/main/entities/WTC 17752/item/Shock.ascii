  description: "Upon command, a shock weapon is sheathed in crackling electricity. The\n  electricity does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another\n  command is given. A shock weapon deals an extra 1d6 points of electricity\n  damage on a successful hit.  Bows, crossbows, and slings so crafted bestow\n  the electricity energy upon their ammunition."
