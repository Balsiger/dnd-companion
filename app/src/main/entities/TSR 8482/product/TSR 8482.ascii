  description: "Hostile in ways that a surface-dweller could never know, the tunnel mazes of the \\Place{Underdark} challenge all who tread there. Among these souls are \\NPC{Drizzt Do\'Urden} and his magical cat, \\NPC{Guenhwyvar}. Exiled from his \\Monster{drow} homeland, \\NPC{Drizzt} must fight for a new home in the boundless labyrinth. Meanwhile, he must watch for signs of pursuit---for the \\Monster{dark elves} are not a forgiving race. \'Salvatore...is both upholding the best traditions of the genre and setting standards that could well become traditions of its next generation.\' Product{Dragon} Magazine."
