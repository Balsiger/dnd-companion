  description: "Amid the storm-tossed vastness of the \\Place{Trackless Sea} west of the mainland, a group of rocky islands lies exposed to the full brunt of winter gales. These isles---the \\Place[Moonshea Isles]{Moonshaes}---are home to some of the hardiest folk of the \\Place{Forgotten Realms}. Now the \\Place[Moonshea Isles]{Moonshaes}---the setting of the first \\Place{Forgotten Realms} novel, \\Product[TSR 8410]{Darkwalker on Moonshae}---are detailed for your role-playing campaign. The cultures, deities, and locales of the isles are described in AD&D game terms. This source book includes full-color maps displaying the \\Place[Moonshea Isles]{Moonshaes} and surrounding islands, many close-up maps depicting particular regions of the \\Place[Moonshea Isles]{Moonsheas}, and all the information you need to establish a campaign on these misty lands with Place{Celtic} roots."
