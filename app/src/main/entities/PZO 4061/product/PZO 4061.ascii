When adventurers meet a demon at a crossroads or ambush an enemy convoy carrying a kidnapped innocent, the Game Master shouldn\'t have to fill in the highway and clumps of wayside bushes. This Pathfinder Map Pack provides beautifully illustrated 5\" x 8\" map tiles that can be combined into a variety of roads and intersections. Inside, you\'ll find 18 richly crafted map tiles, including:\n\n\\list\n{Ambush Site}\n{Crossroads}\n{Muddy Stretch}\n{Roadside Cairn}\n{Stone Bridge}\n{Wayside Copse}\n\nGame Masters shouldn\'t waste their time sketching maps whenever characters set out on a trip. With Pathfinder Map Pack: Road System, you\'ll always have dangers ready as your adventurers make their way into the wide world!"
