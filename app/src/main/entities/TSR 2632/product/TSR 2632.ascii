  description: "\\large{The \\Place{Infinite Staircase} is a planewalker\'s dream. But a dream can turn into a nightmare...} \\emph{Stretching to every plane imaginable, the \\Place{Infinite Staircase} is one of the best-kept secrets of planar travel in the multiverse. Watched over by the mysterious \\Monster{lillendi}, the \\Place{Staircase} stretches in all directions, bending back upon itself to form the ultimate three-dimensional maze---and every landing where the \\Place{Staircase} stops, a doorway to a new planar location awaits the traveler.} The chaotic morass of energy and matter filling \\Place{Limbo} holds a dark secret---the same secret found in the depths of \\Place{Baator}, in an underground hive-city on \\Place{Arcadia}, and in a battle-torn \\Monster{githyanki} fortress on the \\Place{Astral Plane}. Using the \\Place{Infinite Staircase}, a group of planewalkers must travel to these far-flung locations, and elsewhere, to learn of a new threat to the planes---and stop it. Even exploring the \\Place{Staircase} itself can be dangerous, particularly when it\'s ravaged by a barmy \\Monster{fiend} and an even crazier sorceress. \\Product{Tales From the Infinite Staircase} features eight separate but linked adventures presented in a new format. The adventures can be played in any order, yet each scenario impacts upon and changes those played after it. Further, the PCs can return to the individual scenario locations and find that conditions have changed so that more adventuring is possible. Each of the eight adventures can also be played separately. \\Product{Tales From the Infinite Staircase} can be linked with the epic adventure from the \\Product{Forgotten Realms} setting, \\Product{For Duty & Deity}, wherein the heroes must traverse the \\Place{Infinite Staircase} to reach the foreboding realm of \\NPC{Graz\'zt}, a wicked lord of the Place{Abyss}."
