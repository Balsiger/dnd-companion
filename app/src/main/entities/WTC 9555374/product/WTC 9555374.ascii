  description: "\\emph{\\NPC{Kaanyr Vhok}\'s ears popped again, and the whole universe turned upside down.} The \\Monster{half-demon} master of the \\Group{Scoured Legion} still stings from his defeat in \\Place{Menzoberranzan}, and he\'s turned that anger on the human city of \\Place{Sundabar}, and onward into the \\Place{Plane of Fire}. \\emph{\\NPC{Aliisza}\'s head swam. She could remain alive, so long as she was a good girl. But it seemed too easy, too simple. The \\Monster{alu-fiend} knew there was a catch.} She\'s been consort, spy, and soldier, all in support of \\NPC{Kaanyr Vhok}, but when he sends her on a mission she only thinks the understands, \\NPC{Aliisza} finds a secret inside herself, and the unlikeliest allies a \\Monster{demon} could possibly imagine. Delve into the endless expanse of the Forgotten Realms multiverse in an epic adventure across the planes of existence!"
