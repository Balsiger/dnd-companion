Heroes who\n                    fight evil on the \\Place{Prime Material Plane} may contend with forces whose\n                    power rises from the depths of \\Place{Hell}. Adventurers who travel to\n                    \\Place{Hell} meet devildom on its own term and risk not only their lives but\n                    their everlasting souls.\n                    \\Product{Guide to Hell} is a comprehensive look at the nature of\n                    \\Monster{devils}, ways for heroes to battle them, and the twisted geography\n                    and politics of the \\Place{Nine Layers} in the AD&D game.
